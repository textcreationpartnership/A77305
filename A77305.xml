            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It often-times happens that he that ſets out a Book do's juſtly draw injuries upon himſelf without any Reaſon, and giveth cauſe of being told what he is by People that are ſometimes worſe Sots than he: But however I ſhal be as little concerned for what the Publick ſhal ſay of this as <hi>Socrates, who when he was told one that one railed at him behind his back,</hi> his anſwer was, <hi>let him beat me too ſo I am abſent.</hi>

            <p>I have taken no ſmal care in the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of this Treatiſe, for having found the diſcourſe of the firſt Chapter ſomething tedious in the Original in flouriſhing diſcourſes, and little matter according to the <hi>French</hi> way of writing, (a method generally diſapproved by all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Authors) I have in ſuch manner abbreviated it (though without dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the Matter) that it is now plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant enough. But however give me Leave to tell you that this Chapter I

ſpeak of is but an introduction to what follows: I give you this item becauſe I know ſome to be ſo ſqueamiſh, that as ſoon as they have read the firſt two or three Pages of a Book, if that pleaſe them not, they turn to <hi>Finis,</hi> and in their judgment they have read it out, which done, they throw it aſide to mould, and curſe the Author: Some may perhaps wonder to ſee the Songs herein ſet to Muſick, becauſe it is not cuſtomary in ſuch Books: To which I anſwer, that cuſtome is not alwayes to be followed, and that which doth not concur with cuſtome, may ſometimes be eſteemed the greater rarity becauſe not common; 'tis true the word <hi>Song</hi> I have ſeen in many Books over a few Verſes, but what do's it imply without the Muſical-notes? put but (to the Tune of Captain <hi>Digby</hi>'s <hi>Fare-well</hi> over it, or ſome other of the like nature) and then it is not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like a Ballad: if ſome people do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Notes, I doubt not but there are alſo ſome that do, eſpecially Perſons of Quality, and Gentlemen, for

to take himſelf to his reſt ſomething early, which towards the Evening gave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany more cauſe of freedom, not that he loved conſtraint, for his humor was ſo ſweet and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, that it carried him rather to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf familiar and complaiſant to perſons far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath him: Nevertheleſs his illuſtrious Gueſts who were not ignorant in the art of civil Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, could not forbear the manifeſting of ſome Reſpect for his perſon; however, freedom waxing at leaſt more general, he being retired, the cuſtom was to walk in the garden, where with the Muſick and Dancing, were propoſed ſome delightful Queſtions, witty Paſtimes were played which were invented <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intermixt with pleaſing raillery, cauſed by Jocoſe contradictions, would produce ſuch fits of Laughter, and ſuch pleaſures as are ſeldom ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in all companies, and which augmented, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Cavaleer <hi>d'Eſtapes</hi> was moſt acceptably received with Monſieur <hi>de Armenton,</hi> both ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well eſteemed among Perſons of Honor, and very well known in the ſphere of Gallantry. Madam <hi>d'Elus</hi> came alſo, with many other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the ſame diſpoſition, which indeed did but paſs by; but for the time they ſtayed, would be of the Converſations that were held; one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening when the Gueſts of this charming Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were in number above the ordinary, and when they were all wearied with having ſpent the whole after-noon in dancing, the Dutcheſs after a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150024:10"/>
ſmall turn in the Garden, invited the company to go and repoſe themſelves under a green Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, where the Converſations were kept, and which was called the <hi>Circle;</hi> where after ſhe had performed the uſual Ceremonies to oblige them all to ſit down, ſhe deſired Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armand</hi> to be the firſt to invent ſome paſtime, which after ſhe had excuſed herſelf, ſhe did, which ſhe ſaid, was, that every one in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhould invent a ſeveral Paſtime, and we will afterwards make choice of that Perſon ſaid ſhe, whoſe merit ſhall claim the greateſt right in Diverting us, and who ſhall be judged the moſt acceptable; there is already mine added ſhe, and turning to the Abbot <hi>d'Arvuty,</hi> one of the beſt Humored Perſons in the VVorld, and who ſtood juſt by her, ſhe intreated him to begin to tell his Paſtime; but the Abbot refuſed, as thinking ſhe had not told hers, ſhe avouched the contrary, ſaying what ſhe had now done was we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But you (Madam, ſaid ſhe, in directing her Speech to the Dutcheſs) who ſees that Mr. <hi>Abbot</hi> will already not do what he is bid, be ſo good to us your ſelf as to command him to range him to his duty: The Dutcheſs ſmiled, and told her ſhe ſhould be her Lieutenant, and that ſhe ſhould put all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſhe had into her hands, to the end that her Orders may be the better obeyed; whereby the Lady prevailing, ſomething better comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him a ſecond time to find out ſome ſubject
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150024:10"/>
of diverſion; which after a long debate he did, raiſing his diſcourſe upon the qualities of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and upon the blindneſs of Lovers in not diſcerning any defect or blemiſh in them: He would therefore have the Paſtime that Evening be, that every one ſhould relate which of all the Qualities he could principally wiſh that perſon to be endued with which he dearly loved? and ſince it is a kind of neceſſity to have ſome fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, what then ſhould that be he would give her? After Mr. <hi>Abbot</hi> had done, Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armand</hi> as Lieutenant to the Dutcheſs, made a ſigne with her Busk to the Marchioneſs of <hi>Sindal,</hi> to let her know that it was now her turn: But the Dutcheſs replied, that ſince ſhe would not give her ſelf the trouble of inventing ſome paſtime; it were but Juſtice to let the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ladies enjoy the ſame priviledge; beſides, that there were on the mens ſide perſons ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to relate any thing Curious and VVitty, that they had no need to fear the want of Diverſion. I am far Madam, (anſwered her <hi>Madamoiſelle d' Armond</hi>) with a little ſubtile ſmile from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing any thing you ſhall find good; but if you will conſider the wrong this ſilence will do the company, and the advantage theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will reap thereby (who believe that none but they can recount any thing pleaſant) you will find that for a ſmall trouble from which you pretend to deliver theſe Ladies, you deprive us of the Honour we ſhould get by confounding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150024:11"/>
all thoſe great and ratling VVitts, with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of conceits which you ſhould ſee us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce I ſay not (replyed the Dutcheſs) that the Ladies ſhould keep ſilence, I only deſire that the men furniſh the converſation with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and we ſupport it when we ſee it decay, or touch us any thing. Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armand</hi> without making any further anſwer, left Madam <hi>Sindal,</hi> and deſired the Cavaleer to propoſe ſome pleaſing paſtimes, and he obeyed. And his diſcourſe was altogether concerning the Follies all people are inclined to inaffecting ſome one particular thing or other; ſome he eſteems Fools, for affecting Poeſie above all other things; others he ſayes are Fools in Muſick, in Dancing, in Playing, in Arms, in Dogs, in Horſes, and in Cloaths; and therefore ſaid he, it would be a very pleaſant paſtime to tell us every one our Follies, and let them begin with me firſt, and ſincerely tell me in what manner I am fool, and the reaſons they have to believe me ſo. This ſort of paſtime cauſed mirth enough, and there was no body but preſently related after what manner he was believed to be fool; ſo that every ones diſcourſe was of his folly: But in fine, the Baron <hi>d'Exort</hi> who was a moſt gallant Perſon, and who had a pleaſing VVit for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ſaid, that this Paſtime would laſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too long, and that if they would make uſe of another, he would propoſe ſomething that ſhould be more Recreative, and leſs injurious;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150024:11"/>
and he was juſt about relating ſomething to make them merry, when <hi>Madamoiſelle d'Armond</hi> im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enlarged upon, his Propoſition was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, whether it may be poſſible to ſweeten the Rigors of a Cruel Miſtreſs; if it be, in what manner it muſt be done? But <hi>Madamoiſelle d' Ernand,</hi> without whoſe permiſſion none had right to ſpeak, not fixing upon this paſtime (though they were going to ſpeak their thoughts of it) ſpoke to <hi>Monſieur d'Armenton</hi> to propoſe another, telling him it was now his turn: So many Sports ſaid he have been already propoſed, that I will begg the permiſſion of you to remain at ſome one that hath even now been named; for there are enough not only for this Evenings diverſion, but for a whole week, and if you pleaſe I am for that of the Court: No, no, ſaid <hi>Madamoiſelle d' Armand,</hi> we can exempt none but the Ladies from that trouble; tell us then if you pleaſe what your mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth; ſince ſaid he, I am condemned, I ſhould do what you would have me do? The Count with his Queſtion hath furniſhed me with another deſign, which may ſerve us as a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150024:12"/>
paſtime. He would know if there be any thing can ſweeten the rigors of a cruel Miſtreſs. I think that order and reaſon doth firſt require that a Miſtreſs be deſcribed, and that every one relate the qualities they could wiſh to be in a perſon by them loved, it will be the means of knowing every ones inclination: nd I believe that the Count who is ſo particular and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in Love-matters, will doubtleſs give us pleaſure enough to hear him, for he will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neate the Picture of an admirable Miſtreſs; the <hi>Count</hi> was going to anſwer him, but <hi>Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle d'Armand</hi> who inſtantly had a mind that this Paſtime ſhould paſs, prevented him, and told the Dutcheſs that if ſhe pleaſed, it ſhould be by this they would begin, and that it was too gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant not to be preferred before any other. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Dutcheſs took the advice of all the company, who were of the ſame mind, and without delaying any more, they deſired <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle d'Armond</hi> to command ſome body to begin, which turning her ſelf to the <hi>Count de Lorme,</hi> ſhe did, ſaying, it ſhall be you then Sir that muſt begin; and tell us after what manner you would have a Lady made and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied if you had one that might be for your own appetite: I know not continued ſhe how ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful you will be, but I imagine that you having Opinions ſo different from the reſt of the world, eſpecially in this, will aſſuredly give ſome cauſe of contradiction: There was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

begun a hot diſpute; but the Lady <hi>Sindal</hi> interrupted them, and told them it was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy late, and that they muſt in good earneſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther begin then, or defer it till the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that the <hi>Count</hi> might alſo have the more time to prepare himſelf: I ſaid the <hi>Count</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly,) ſhall not do like theſe Leapers who leap yet worſe when they are naked, than when they are cloathed: If it be too late, it is ſo much the better for me becauſe not having much time, I ſhall not have much to re ate; and what I ſhall then ſay, <hi>ex tempore,</hi> will be much more excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than what I might have ſtudied for, though it were better. I will without waiting till to morrow, give you my thoughts upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which you will diſcern to be without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther method or choice; yea muſt grant (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he) that the matter is altogether delicate, which you have put into my hands. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſince my buſineſs is not to form a Lady to the mind of the whole world, but two make one after my mind, I will tell you in few words how I would have her adorned and beautified, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem her perfectly; imagine it not to be one of thoſe fine VVomen, which theſe Gentlemen would doubtleſs lay before you if they were in my place, that is not my deſign; that with which I ſhall entertain you ſhall be a Lady of Honour, whoſe principalleſt Qualities ſhall be grounded on the merit of her perſon. The firſt thing ſhe muſt have, is a good Birth, and not to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150024:13"/>
ignorize the maintaining of her Rank as ſhe ought, without being too much affected, as moſt VVomen are; my meaning is, that her whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and all her actions may witneſs her to be a perſon of Quality, ſhe ſhould have ſome of that modeſty, which mingled with Majeſty as doth give a glorious luſtre to Noble perſons, for her VVit let it flow naturally, and let her Body be well ſhaped; but let her have more eſpecially a particular Grace in all her actions, that may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Amicable at the firſt view, that it may be an Ornament to accompany all her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that is rare ſaid <hi>Madamoiſelle d'Armand,</hi> but me-thinks if you a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is anſwered her the <hi>Count</hi> preſently, what may be ſeen in you Madam; and if you pleaſe, I will not make any other Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſince it is but to regard you to divine what it is. This anſwer cauſed <hi>Madamoiſelle d'Armand</hi> to bluſh, and ſhe was doubtleſs going to anſwer him, if the Dutcheſs had not made a ſign to her not to interrupt him any more, and the <hi>Count</hi> continued his diſcourſe in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſince I am deſired to draw the Picture of my <hi>Heroine</hi> at large, I will prepare my ſelf to let you ſee her altogether. I have already ſaid that her Body ſhould be well ſhaped, I mean of a juſt and well compoſed height, free and without
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150024:13"/>
affectation, though ſomething above the mean, yet without the exceſs of being too Great; the Opinions are very different between the Brown and the Fair; for my part I am for the Brown, becauſe they have commonly moſt VVit: As to what concerns the figure of the Viſage, I have ever heard ſay, that thoſe who have it Oval, promiſe moſt Friendſhip; as for the Eyes, they are yet diſputable: but the Black are in my mind the moſt beautiful, if they are full and well divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſuch a fair one whoſe Picture I draw, ought eſpecially to have her Teeth white, and well ranked: the mouth ſmall and roſie coloured, the fore-head and chin proportionable to the Pori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyre of her Viſage; and for her Qualities (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded he) I will not ſpeak of thoſe Vertues ſo common for all Women, it is to be ſuppoſed that a Lady ſo well made as I make her, wanteth not thoſe Vertues, but to diſtinguiſh her from the Vulgar ſort, ſhe ought to have ſome particular Qualities, as much civility, much ſweetneſs in all her words, but in converſation eſpecially; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a certain ready way of never ſaying any thing but to the purpoſe, according to the place wherein ſhe is, and according to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the perſons to whom ſhe ſpeaks, her actions ought to be very obliging, and ſhe ſhould have a good nature ſo charming as might ſurprize an eſteem in the hearts of perſons of Honor; ſhe muſt have a lively Wit that may cauſe her to be admired, but a ſprightlineſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150024:14"/>
with ſomething of gravity, that may ſhow in her as much ſoundneſs in judgment, as promptneſs of wit: She muſt beware praiſing her ſelf, for there is ever too much vanity and indiſcretion in doing of it in what manner ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhe ought to have the ſame regard in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, which muſt be but little &amp; to the purpoſe, and let affectation be avoided in diſcourſe as well as carriage, and in all things elſe, ſuch quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will cauſe her to be conſidertd, wherever ſhe is, while others fall more or leſs into the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Errors. Let her not neglect Inſtruments, Muſick, and Dancing; let her alſo make ſome eſteem of Poetry, Hiſtory, and of that we call Literature.</p>
            <p>There the <hi>Count</hi> made a ſtand, as if he would have made an end, or taken breath, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done, the Abbot ſaid that the Count had drawn the Picture of ſo rare a Lady, that he could ſcarce believe there were any like her in the World. Nevertheleſs ſaid he, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what he has ſaid, his diſcourſe was of things altogether in general, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a few Leſſons will he give the Ladies. I cannot believe that his hath yet all ſhe ſhould have. I could anſwer you ſaid the Count, that I am not obliged to do more than the order of the paſtime, which required me to deſcribe a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to my liking. But you Mr. <hi>Abbot</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he who imag nes what I have ſaid to be ſo extraordinary, that you cannot believe there are many
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150024:14"/>
ſuch in the World, although I have not yet done: You have ſaid me-thinks ſomething too much be ore a Company where there is not a Lady but may be compared to her; I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and I may truly ſay that they were my pattern. I ſee your deſign replyed the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot to him ſmiling, you would make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between me and this Sex, and cauſe theſe Ladies to be my adverſaries, while you in the mean time intrude your ſelf by your flatteries to obtain their good wills; but they are ſo juſt, that they love truth better (though it might ſeem to be againſt them) than the falſe praiſes that you give them. Nevertheleſs if my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune ſhould cauſe it to happen otherwiſe, I cannot but ſay that it is not only rare to find all theſe qualities in one only VVoman, but that the like can be ſaid but of few men, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they are capable of a far greater perfection than Women, to hear Mr. <hi>Abbot</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſaid <hi>Monſieur d' Arwenton</hi> one would imagine that he hath a mind to ſpeak againſt the VVomen: but if the Count will give me leave to anſwer him, I will have the honor to ſerve him as ſecond on the behalf of theſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. You oblige me ſaid the Count, for I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe think that I have already done what I was obliged to do; and the Ladies quarrel cannot be ill in the management of ſo gallant a man as you. Mr. <hi>Abbot</hi> was going to ſpeak, but the Dutcheſs prevented him, and bid him keep thoſe injuries
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150024:15"/>
he had to ſay againſt them, till the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, that it was now too late to have time enough to relate them; that ſhe would give him the whole Night to conſider on it if he dare be ſo bold to expoſe himſelf to ſo great a hazard; all the Company ſmiled upon the Dutcheſs, who had turned the ſubject of this new diſpute in ſo gallant a manner, it was referred till the next day.</p>
            <p>Here the Paſtime ended, and the Violins (that were placed round about the Arbor) having begun to play, at a ſign the Dutcheſs made them, they all aroſe, and daunced as they went till they came to the Houſe, whereafter ſome Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities the Dutcheſs made the Company, and which is uſual on ſuch occaſions, they all walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Chambers, and gave the remainder of the night over to ſleep.</p>

I ſhall (perhaps) be obliged to keep my word if I am urged to it: Rut it ſhall be to ſay nought againſt you, than what I cannot forbear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: VVe ſhall ſee that ſaid Madam <hi>d' Elus</hi> to him; however it is not of ſo ſmall a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as not to deſerve the pains to think a little upon it.

that the fright of it had like to have made him fall all along: it is to be imagined how the Ladies laughed, the Lady <hi>Sindal,</hi> whoſe Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not far, came at this noiſe, and asked what the matter was? ſee you not (an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But it continued not long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Duke ſent to them to know if they would be for Hunting, that the weather was fair, and that they had nought to do, but to get themſelves ready. The Ladies had a deſire to be of the number; they were moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly received; nought elſe was thought on but breakfaſt; the Horſes and Hounds were ſoon in a readineſs: inſomuch that in leſs than two hours, breakfaſt was done; they mounted on Horſe-back, and into the ſpacious Fields they went. Dayes are not alwaies fortunate, nor
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150024:16"/>
always proper for Hunting: however this was, and they reliſhed the pleaſure ſo well, that they returned not till the Evening to Supper; our Hunters were almoſt ſtarved: The Ladys had good ſtomacks, and there wanted not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to content them; for the Table was ſo ſumptuouſly adorned, that I can hardly believe <hi>Paris</hi> can ſhew better chear; they begun with little or no diſcourſe, becauſe every one did his endeavour to feed well; about the middle of Supper ſome diſcourſe paſſed concerning Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But at the laſt they fell upon the diſpute that ſhould ſerve for the converſation this Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; Madtmoiſelle <hi>d'Armaud</hi> failed not to ſet hpon Mr <hi>Abbot,</hi> nor he to defend himſelf well.

Nature will bring forth a VVoman, when ſhe produceth ſomething, becauſe it is a ſubject ſo neceſſary to the end ſhe tends to, which is to conſerve the kind. We need not read any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, either ancient or modern, to know that there have been VVomen that have waged VVar, and that have obtained Victories; that they had been ſeated upon Throans, and governed States and Kingdoms with an admirable pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and adminiſter Juſtice with as much ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and wiſdom as the firſt Judges of the world. I dare ſay more, and I'll maintain that the men have not done any thing worthy commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but what the VVomen have done alſo; they have made it evident enough, that Sciences were not ſecrets for the men alone; they have penetrated as far as poſſible into them; and you are not ignorant that there have been of them that have underſtood Philoſophy very well, and that have inſtructed men therein: Others that have been very expert in Poeſie; yea they have gone even to the knowledg of the Laws, of which Study they have rendred themſelves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry capable; it would be ſomething tedious to relate all that may be ſaid upon this Subject, and to report that which an infinity of Authors have ſaid for the VVomens advantage. It is true ſaid the Abbot, that if you once enter into Hiſtory, and when I am not permitted to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt you, theſe Ladies will doubtleſs believe you have conquered; but you are not yet
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150024:18"/>
where (perhaps) you think you are; believe it ſometimes a dangerous conſequence to purſue an Enemy, that maketh a feigned Retreat. It would be no difficult matter for me to anſwer to what you have ſaid; but I will only bring one Reaſon in oppoſition to this pretended Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male perfection, which is, that the man reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Form, and the woman the matter; and that as the form is more perfect than the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Man is alſo more perfect than the VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but there is one thing which all the world knows, and which makes the advantage that we have above the Woman evident; it is that there are but few Women but would gladly be men; and very few Men that deſire to be Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. If you have no better Reaſons replied Monſieur <hi>d' Armenton</hi> ſmiling, my glory will be but ſmall in having vanquiſhed you, they are ſuch cold ones (continued he) that they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of freezing our underſtandings in the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weather of this ſeaſon. This unhappy Sex have reaſon to have theſe deſires, not for their being more perfect, but to deliver themſelves from the unſupportable Yoak of men; and for the enjoyment of Liberty, which their only Tyranny hath raviſhed from them. But I pray tell me what compariſon is there of the matter and form with the Man and the Woman? the matter hath its eſſence from the form, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without it; whereas the man and the Woman receive from each other an equal perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;

I agree (proceeded Monſieur <hi>d'Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menton,</hi>) that Heat in it ſelf is more perfect than Cold: but it is not the ſame in things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and which we call mixt, as Men and VVomen are for then it would fall out, that the hotteſt bodies ſhould be the moſt perfect, which is falſe, ſince there is nothing but what is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate hath a true perfection. Let us add, that VVomen are in effect of a cold Temperature, in compariſon of Men, who for being too hot, ſtray from perfection, which is not found but in things that are temperate; but VVomen as to themſelves are not too cold; and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nearer to that perfect ſtate we ſpeak of than men; for they have in them this moiſture which is proportionable to the natural heat, that the too great drineſs in men diſſipates and conſumes too ſoon: but if timorouſneſs in VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be as you ſay, a mark of imperfection, it is not from their conſtitution that it cometh, but from a too great livelineſs of wit, which inſtantly repreſenting them the objects in the underſtanding, is the cauſe that they are ſo eaſily terrified; becauſe they have not the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150024:20"/>
to conſult their reaſon upon that which ſtrikes them ſo ſuddenly; and this cannot be termed imperfection, ſince it proceeds from ſo fair a cauſe.</p>
               <p>You may ſee many men that have neither fear of death, nor any thing elſe; and yet they may not be termed Valiant men, becauſe they know not dangers, and go amazedly where the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer is open; Theſe actions proceed from a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery Brutality, and from a cloudy Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and without knowledg fools are not peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a great courage. True valour depends upon a mans proper reſolution, and upon a will determinately bent to do ſomething; and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem Glory and his Duty above all things in the world; beſides, a man like this will meet death in neceſſary occaſions, although he knows the peril to be evident; his mind will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and heart-couragious to purſue (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble) an enterprize even to the end. We have ſeen many VVomen act with this force and courage. We know that they have done acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo full of Glory, that the Men have been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comparable to them, and I believe I ſhall not ſay ſo much, when I ſay, that antiquity cannot ſhow us any of conſiderable merit. But it may be made appear that his VVife, his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or his Siſters Fame hath equalized this. VVill you have more?

All thoſe Reaſons (anſwered him the Abbot) which experience contradicts, me thinks are not good: and certainly if I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked you who theſe admirable VVomen were from whom the Men have received ſome Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: I believe I ſhould entrap you if there be any thing (ſaid Monſieur <hi>d Armenton</hi>) that might entangle me; it would be the too great number of Examples that there are of what I ſay; and if I feared not to ſay thoſe things which the company already knoweth, I would begin with the Hiſtory of <hi>Octavia</hi> VVife to <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> there is no Body her-but knows this Hiſtory, as well as that of <hi>Porcia,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Cato,</hi> and VVife of <hi>Brutus:</hi> Who hath not heard of <hi>Caja Cecilia</hi> the Wife of <hi>Tarquin Priſens</hi> of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and of I know not how many others, that are not only known among our Ladies, but among the ſtrangeſt and moſt barbarous Nations.

They embarqued in Ships, a great many of which after they had been beaten with the tempeſts, and ran a thouſand dangers upon this terrible Element; they came at laſt to take Port in <hi>Italy,</hi> upon the Coaſts where the River <hi>Tiber</hi> glides into the Sea; they lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, plundered the Country, and by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of their weapons they got where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to keep them from want. VVhile they were buſied with theſe actions, their VVives, who feared nothing ſo much than that they would to Sea again, being one day gathered together in a field by the Sea-ſide, determined by the perſwaſions of one of the principal of them whoſe Name was <hi>Roma,</hi> to put an end to their troubles, and in good time to deliver themſelves from thoſe hazards they ſhould venture upon the Seas, and from all thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities that are to be endured in that wandring Life that they lead, ſince they had left their Country to follow their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</p>

Theſe unhappy Fugitives ſeeing no other refuge, after the deſtruction of their veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, were obliged to make themſelves an abode. The Land where they were appeared very pleaſant; they found the Natives to be of a good and civil behaviour, and they believed that after all, it was not the worſt part their wives had conſtrained them to take; they built them a City then which was afterwards called <hi>Roma;</hi> the name of her that firſt gave the counſel before-mentioned: I need not add to this the Hiſtory of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> ſince it is too well known.

What you ſay there (replied the Abbot) is doubtleſs contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what you think; for there is no Body but knoweth that the women have ever been leſs reſerved than the men; but if that were not, who can ſay that there is not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream difference: You know that by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of one woman, a thouſand misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes follow; whereas by the diſorder of one man, thete happens nothing, or very little. Theſe are very ſtrong arguments (ſaid Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>d'Armenton</hi> to him in raillery.) I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you have been ſo long on thinking of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but that to ſay to me. But yet I pray, why would not you have Vice to be as much and more condemnable in men than wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; ſince it is from them that moſt Vertue is expected. Let us us ſpeak the truth (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he) and confeſs that this Tyrannical Empire which we have uſurped over them, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizeth
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:150024:32"/>
our Crimes, and that the ſame acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which in us are eſteemed Honourable, were they in them, we would condemn them to death, or at leaſt to an Eternal Infamy. The Abbot anſwered him nothing, becauſe he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that if he ſhould adventure to ſay any thing too bitter againſt theſe Ladies, he ſhould bring ſome new misfortune upon him: but they diſcerned in his face the violence he did, to hinder him from ſpeaking his thoughts, which gave a very pleaſant ſubject of Laughter: At length when they had done their mirth, the Company intreated Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>d' Armand</hi> to give them a Song, which ſhe did in the enſuing words with much skill and judgement.</p>

               <p>After which, (and the due applauſes, the company gave Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armond</hi> for the ſame) it being late, and the Dutcheſs fearing the Dukes ſitting up too long, the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ended; the Company parted with the uſual Ceremonies, and each took their way to their Lodging.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>THis day paſſed no leſs pleaſantly than the others; there were Playes, Dances, and many other Diverſions to entertain the Company with from the morning that they were dreſſed, till eight of the clock in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening that they went to Supper; after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per they failed not to go into the Garden, where they fetched ſome turns in the walks, and afterwards reſorted to the Arbour, where the Circle was kept. The Abbot had been ſo evil treated the day before, that he had no mind to renew the diſpute. It was the Dutcheſs that began the diſcourſe, and who ſaid to the Count <hi>de Lorme,</hi> that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whoſe Picture he had given, was a perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fair and civil Woman; but that there were notwithſtanding perſons in the company, who think that for a Court-Lady as he would have made her, there was ſomething yet wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and that he ſhould make an end. I know not ſaid the Baron <hi>d'Epare</hi> what may be ſaid of the Counts Lady; but in my opinion a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cannot be made better qualified; and that is all can be deſired in a Woman. However you ſhall ſee (anſwered him the Dutcheſs) that if he pleaſeth, he will give her new per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and that he will add to this piece
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:150024:34"/>
ſome Features above the reſt that ſhall not ſpoil her: I know not Madam, ſaid the Count, what there yet is wanting in this work; but for my part I confeſs that a Lady like her would pleaſe me very well; and he that is not contented with her, let him leave her to me, I know very well where to beſtow her: The pleaſant Air with which the Count pronounced theſe words, made the Company to laugh. But what (ſaid the Counteſs <hi>d' Ancyre</hi>) would you not teach a perſon ſo accompliſhed, how ſhe ought to behave her ſelf in matters of Love? for I imagine you would not have her incapable of thoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and beautiful as you have made her, it is at leaſt impoſſible for her not to inſpire it. Tell us then (continued this Lady) how ſhe ought to comport her ſelf with a Gallant Perſon that doth ſincerely love her. It is true (ſaid the Lady <hi>Sindal</hi>) that theſe are two things which a Court-Lady ought not to be ignorant of, eſpecially the laſt, becauſe it oftner hapneth that the men make ſhow of Love, than to Love in reality; he muſt firſt tell us (ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armond</hi>) with what Air a Woman muſt receive a declaration of Love, and whether ſhe muſt not diſſemble with all Lovers, or anſwer ſome of them? We muſt firſt (ſaid the Count) rather learn a Lady to know Lovers, to know how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the true from the falſe: As for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:150024:35"/>
or not anſwering their Love, I believe in that ſhe ought to take her own counſel; this then (added the Dutcheſs) is wanting in your Heroine, in which if you pleaſe you muſt inſtruct her, or I will be the firſt my ſelf that will ſay ſhe hath failings, ſince ſhe is not yet skilled in Lovers; you muſt tell us (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe) <hi>what are the moſt certain marks to know true Love, and what it is can convince your Lady to perſwade her to love;</hi> for in fine it hath been a ſaying a great while, <hi>that a Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to love when ſhe believeth her ſelf loved; if her Lover be endued with theſe Perfections that may deſerve Love.</hi> What you ask of me Madam (anſwered her the Count) is cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome enough; for if we muſt ſpeak the truth, the men are now ſuch Cheats in this, that the prudenteſt Women are the firſt that are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; we ſee them ſometimes complain, weep, and ſigh when they have a mind to laugh and the moſt part are ſo accuſtomed to it, that in one and the ſame day they will let fall Tears at at the feet of two or three Miſtreſſes, and will promiſe them a fidelity not to be parallel'd; and if I might be believed, they ſhould make an example of theſe falſe-hearted ſighers, and a good part of them ſhould be ſent into ſome deſert Iſland. However to the end the Lady whoſe Picture I have given you, and of whom I muſt take a particular protection) may not be deceived in the choice ſhe ſhall make of a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:150024:35"/>
Lover; I am obliged to give her ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, by which ſhe may regulate her Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>When the Count had gone thus far, a Lacquey belonging to the Dutcheſs (who had been ſent to <hi>Paris</hi> to fetch ſome Letters which he was to take at the Poſt-houſe) brought ſome for many perſons of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and put them all into the hands of his Miſtreſs: There was at firſt a little confuſion in the Circle: the impatience which they all had about the Letters, occaſioned them to riſe from their places, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one endeavoured to know if there was none for them. The Dutcheſs who had a mind to engage her ſelf from the trouble, put them all into the Lady <hi>Sindals</hi> hand to take care to deliver them; but this Lady who had a deſire to partake of ſome mirth, deſired them immediatly all to betake themſelves to their places again, and that ſhe would give chem all ſatisfaction. I ſee well ſaid the Dutcheſs, that how gallant ſoever the ſubject was which we even now propoſed, the curioſity of Letters will carry it, and that there will be given but little attention to what the Count ſhall tell us; wherefore Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam continued the Dutcheſs, in addreſſing her ſelf to the Lady <hi>Sindal;</hi> if you will believe me, you muſt quit your ſelf of theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as ſoon as you can, and deliver them
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:150024:36"/>
to the Owners; we will afterwards begin the Converſation. If you deſire ſo anſwered the Lady <hi>Sindal,</hi> I conſent; but it is certain that we ſhall have but little time left for a matter ſo gallant as is that which we have given the Count; and beſides, you will ſee that they will be prevented after they have read theſe Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ters, that they will ſcarcely anſwer the diſcourſe; and the Count will have the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſie done him of relating curious things to perſons that will not hear him: For my part added ſhe, if I may be believed, a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation might be made even from theſe Letters, and the Count might retain his for another time; I may have ſome here as well as the reſt, for truly I expect ſome that are witty enough too; if you pleaſe we will make choice of ſome of the company that ſhall read them out; but without naming from whence, nor from whom they come, except the perſons intereſſed order otherwiſe. There was no Body but approved the deſign of the Lady <hi>Sindal,</hi> no body would oppoſe it, for fear of giving the company leave to think they had ſome private Intelligence. The Dutcheſs nevertheleſs, according to her ordinary pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would have ſome order kept, and that they who ſhould be choſen to read theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſhould firſt let the perſons ſee them to whom they belonged, to ask them whether they might be expoſed, or whether they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:150024:36"/>
would give them permiſſion. This reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſerved for little; there was nothing in theſe Letters that might not be communicated to ſo judicious and reaſonable a company as this was; however it was judged neceſſary to do thus to avoid troubleſom inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Madam <hi>d'Elus</hi> who was a Woman no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for wiſdom and diſcretion through all the world, was the perſon choſen to take this care. The firſt Letter which came to her hand, (for it was through hazard ſhe took them,) was for the Cavaleer <hi>d'Eſtapes,</hi> and without naming from whom, nor from whence it came; after ſhe had ſhewed it him, and asked him the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to read it, ſhe found it as followeth:

                        <p>IN two moneths time I have received none of your Letters; Why ſo? am I by you ſo much forgot? or is there ſome misfortune come upon you? how cruel are you? tell me if there be any one more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in your Concerns than my ſelf; and if you ought to neglect me ſo far, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you owe me not at leaſt ſo feeble a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, in truth you love me not; ſince you can let ſo much time paſs away in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: I perceive very well that all thoſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:150024:37"/>
marks of tenderneſs which you have given me, were but a meer effect of your ſpirit, your heart had no part; there was at leaſt more of complaiſance than amity; it was through Exchange, and not through incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; for I know not how one can love after the manner as I mean, and live as you do: You know what you promiſed me when you parted hence, and how you would render me an account every eight daies as long as you lived: I did let my ſelf be flattered ſo patiently, that the only hope of this cauſed me to endure the firſt dayes of your abſence with patience; there is nothing eaſier than to abuſe the credulity of a heart that loves us; but there is nothing more baſe or more black neither. I endeavoured to comfort my ſelf for the Regret that I had of your abſence after I had been ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to it through the pleaſure I hoped to have had by a ſmall commerce of Letters which we ſhould read together: You have not let me enjoy this pleaſure but a ſmall time.

You cannot anſwered her the Cavalier; and I aver more, that none of the company know the perſon that writ to me, and that ſhe is above fifty leagues from this place: be it what it will ſaid the Dutcheſs, me-thinks this Letter is very tender and paſſionate, and that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier is the unjuſteſt of all men if he can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a perſon that hath ſuch inclinations for him; it is alſo Madam, anſwered her the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier what I have never done, and which is beyond my power to do, for it is truth

that the eſteem and tenderneſs which I have for this perſon is of a Character never to be effaced. Into that (ſaid the Counteſs <hi>d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyre</hi> to him) we will not penetrate; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you ſhow your ſelf ſtrangely cruel; and it may be ſaid, that you do not act gallantly in maintaining the ſentiments you ſay you have for her ſo illy; it is not, (anſwered her the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier) for having failed in doing my duty. And if this Lady received none of thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I writ, it is not me ſhe muſt blame, but ſome naughty Demon that endeavoureth to croſs us. See ſaid the Lady <hi>Sindal</hi> how theſe Traytors of men cover their ſeditiouſneſs ſo ſoon as they have got at a ſmall diſtance from their Miſtreſſes; all they endeavour is but to make Love at new coſts: beſides a relique of goodneſs that there is yet remains in them, wil not permit them to write them Treaſons, no, they wil rather forbearall correſpondence with them, &amp; at the firſt reproaches they ſhal receive from them, they have preſently recourſe to that commanding, pretence that their Letters were miſcarried: for my part (I doubt not continued ſhe) but the Cavalier is one of theſe, I have known him long for a perſon very wavering in the greateſt engagements. Perhaps (anſwered her the Cavalier) that if you knew.— Alas, (replied the ſame La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy preſently interrupting him) I know but too well of your infidelities, and if my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:150024:38"/>
might be followed or to puniſh you for the injuſtice which you have done this Fair-one that writes to you, the company ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige you to recite to us preſently all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of this ſtory. This ſentence was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by all; the Cavalier was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned without appeal: he did well to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf, all his Arguments were miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: at length he obeyed his Judges, and in this manner.</p>
               <p>It is ſome time ſince (ſaid he) I travelled in a Province that is none of the fartheſt from <hi>Paris,</hi> and where ſome certain affairs called me, it being the firſt time I had been there; it was not very difficult for me to looſe my way: this misfortune hapned to me late in the evening, and when I leaſt thought of it, I conceived my error, when it was too late to ſeek a remedy. I found my ſelf upon the cloſing up of the night in the middle of a wood, where the farther I went, the more I found my ſelf incumbred, and there was no hope of getting out; it was in the winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſon, the weather was very rough, and the wayes very bad, and that time of night, it was as impoſſible for me to turn back again, as it was for me to paſs further in, but I armed my ſelf with reſolution, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelf with patience, waiting under a Tree for the break of day, which I thought better than a thouſand hazards that there is in croſſing the ditches, which we ſhould every

moment meet with: I forbear telling you the ſmall pleaſure there is to be reduced to this extremity: but this I thought ſhould be the laſt adventure of a Knight-errand that ſhould happen to me any more. I entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my ſelf with theſe and the like melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts, when by good Fortune I eſpied a peyſant not far off of us, who was going homeward: I ſent my Valtet to him to bid him come to me, and who followed him only by the noiſe, for we could not ſee the night was ſo obſcure; he overtook him, and engaged him with fair words and promiſes to conduct us to ſome ſhelter; at firſt he told us that we were at leaſt two leagues from the right road, and that he knew no place nearer to lodge in than a league from thence, where we went the moſt deteſtable way that is poſſible to be imagine; at length we came to a ſmall Village, in which was but one Cabaret to drink a pint of Wine in. God knows how we were treated, after we had knock'd at the door an hour to oblige the Hoſt to let us in, who would not, but upon the Faith of our Guide, who ſwore to him we were honeſt people. The Peyſant ſtayed with us, eat, drank, and lay in the ſame Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret; for my part who had for my be nothing but a miſerable Pallat, and two thin Ruggs; I paſſed not the night ſo well as he, but better nevertheleſs than I ſhould have done in the middle of the wood. The trouble, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:150024:39"/>
and wearineſs that I had had, ſerved me at length in lieu of a pillow, inſomuch that about the break of day, I fell aſleep. I had not repoſed two hours, but this Peaſant enters my chamber, and waking me very rudely, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth me, that Madam the Abbeſs waited to ſpeak with me in the Parlor. I received this Compliment with a very bad air; I knew not what he meant by Madam <hi>l' Abbeſs,</hi> and thought in the ſame inſtant to have forgot all the obligation I owed him for the laſt night; the poor man knew very well by my reception of him, that he had done me no very good Office, although he believed he had done me ſervice: he departed, and went to carry the anſwer I gave him, to the party that ſent him. On my ſide it was not poſſible for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my ſleep again, and I thought only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what this man had told me, that an Abbeſs asked for me: I knew no body in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and I did truly imagine that there might be (ſome abiſs of Religious perſons at the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but I could not divine why I ſhould be ſent for; I did effectively believe that they took me for another: Be it how it could, I was troubled that I had ſo illy anſwered this Civility; and if the Peyſant would faithfully report the unpleaſant manner of my ſending him back, this Abbeſs had as much reaſon to blame me, as I had to praiſe her. This refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made me ſomething ſad; but it hapned
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150024:40"/>
very well to the purpoſe to deliver me: This Ladies Millar came (after this Peaſant) to tell me with an air a little more ceremoniouſly, that Madam <hi>l' Abbeſs</hi> (ſince this Village be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to her) having underſtood by her Shepherd that a perſpn of Quality having mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtook his way, had been conſtrained to lye in a miſerable Cabaret, did ſend him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat me to accept of a place leſs incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then that wherein I was. This Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment baniſhed all my melancholy, and I would no harm to my Peaſant now, becauſe it was he that procured me the Honor this Abbeſs did me. I anſwered him with as much Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as it was poſſible for me, and prayed him to aſſure his Lady that I had the moſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging reſentments in the world for the Grace ſhe did me, and that I would not be long to come and teſtifie them my ſelf to her, which I did after the manner I am going to tell you.</p>
               <p>My man being already up, I cauſed him to give me an indifferent handſom Suit of Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and I put me into an Equipage Cavalier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, enough for this Viſit: The Peaſant who ſerved me as my Guide, conducted me alſo to Madam the Abbeſs. I went firſt into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, where ſhe made me not to ſtay long for her.</p>
               <p>I believe before I proceed, it will be better for me to make a deſcription of this Abbeſs to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150024:40"/>
you, which it may be will not diſpleaſe you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Imagine it to be a Maid of about</hi> 28 <hi>Years of Age, of an indifferent height, but well ſhaped in her Growth; ſhe had a good head of hair, and flaxen coloured, the Eyes black and fair, the mouth admirable handſom, the Teeth paſsable, the Noſe well ſhaped, and the turn of her Viſage round, and ſo pretty, that for to ſpeak the truth, ſhe was fitter to inſpire Love, than Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſhe had likewiſe an air ſo Sweet and Modest, that in charming did imprint I know not what reſpect, which did abate the Courage; her very Voice had ſomething of particular; and one cannot ſay how much without affectation; ſhe had the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of an Abbeſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaw this perſon, and if I muſt diſguiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I'll confeſs I loved her from the very firſt moment I ſaw her; I thought no more on the night I had paſſed with ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; nay I forgot my ſelf ſo far, as to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſelf Priſoner to this fair one. It is true that the knots were not ſo ſtrong as not to be broak, or at leaſt to ſtretch; but however, in ſuch manner that it would cauſe one to feel them when one hath a deſire to ſerve a perſon that pleaſeth one extremely. This fair Abbeſs
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150024:41"/>
Conquered all that Country; at my firſt Viſit ſhe told me very obligingly at firſt, that ſhe could have deſired that I had paſſed my time leſs incommodiouſly than I did in that Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, and that ſhe would pray me to abide this day with her, that I might repoſe my ſelf for the laſt nights wearineſs: the prayer was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging; and as in civility, I could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe her proffer; I did it with ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, that it was eaſie for her to diſcern that I had yet no mind to be going. But as ſhe had a gallant piercing wit, ſhe made uſe of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in telling me, that if ſhe had not the power over me ſhe would have to cauſe my ſtay, ſhe was certain that two or three of her Friends would engage me at my firſt view of them, and that I ſhould not have force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough perhaps to refuſe their requeſt as I had hers, which ſaid, ſhe as ſoon called the Ladies ſhe ſpoke of: But I that pretended the Honour wholly due to her, aſſured her that ſhe ſhould tempt me in vain on her Friends parts, in a thing which ſhe her ſelf could not obtain of me; and that I believed there was nothing in the world had ſo much power over a rational ſpirit as ſhe, nor that could cauſe themſelves to be better obeyed when they deſired any thing; the Abbeſs gave attention to what I ſaid, and received my Careſſes as I deſired, ſhe was endued with vertue intermixt with modeſty: Nevertheleſs flattery always would
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:150024:41"/>
find reſiſtance, and ſeldom would ſhe ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her defence, but with much violence and paſſion; ſhe knew ſhe was fair, and although ſhe would not make uſe of her Beauty to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate hearts as a perſon of the world, yet would not ſhe be ſo negligent of it, but that ſhe would rejoyce in private that ſhe was not eſteemed unhandſome: the other three Nuns her Friends, whoſe company ſhe had ſent for, came juſt in the inſtant as ſhe was going to anſwer me; but her mind preſently changing, here is ſaid ſhe (turning her ſelf about) that will make you revoak what you ſaid but even now. I ſhall leave you with them for an hour. I have ſome ſmall buſineſs, and I hope by the time of my return we ſhall ſee you in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion. I ſwear to you Madam (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red I ſoftly, becauſe I would not be heard by the other) that this ſhall be the laſt opinion I'll carry from hence; and that if I could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the leaſt cauſe of alteration, I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly depart. She anſwered but with a ſmile, which was doubtleſs for fear ſhe ſhould explain her ſelf too far before perſons that would not have been ſuſpitious, had they not been intereſſed in what ſhe ſaid to me. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a ſomething freer converſation with theſe Ladies than I did with the Abbeſs. I knew already that it was not illy taken by them that I was not over ſerious, and that they uſed it only to thoſe from whom they fear envious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150024:42"/>
and cauſeleſs cenſure: But with me who was but a Young man, and a lover of mirth, and who only was there for ſometime, and who delighted in nothing more than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing; it were time loſt to uſe formalities in a firſt Viſit; in effect they received my airy humor not illy, and ranged themſelves to it in a moſt agreeable manner: In my life I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee more wit than were in thoſe three La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; all that they ſpoke ſparkled, baniſhing that Monacal Humor, hat poyſoneth all the beſt of a Religious Ladies diſcourſe that is infected with it. I believe it will not ſeem tedious to you if I delineate the Pictures of thoſe I ſpeak of, as I did that of the Abbeſs, eſpecially one of them which was her Siſter, who is ſhe that hath the greateſt part in this Hiſtory, and who writ the Letter you juſt now heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was a Virgin of an admirable ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whoſe skin was extream white, and the turn of her face Oval, the eyes fair and fiery; if ſhe was defective in any thing, it was that ſhe had too much perfection; her voice was very ſweet, and ſhe would ſing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely; never was anything better ſhaped, nor any thing of a purer Vermillion red than her lips; the whiteneſs of her ivory teeth did anſwer admirable well to that rare
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:150024:42"/>
Carnation; and the air which proceeded from that amiable mouth was ſomething of ſuch ſweetneſs, that there could not breathe a purer; we must add to theſe lovely Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that ſhe had as much wit as any could have, and an underſtanding that knew al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies what to ſay; and that would ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what was worthy admiration; her Soul was the faireſt that ever virtue had a hand in forming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The piece ſhall here end: they are grown troubleſom ſince they are not A-la-mode; I'll only ſay, that this Lady had nothing common in her, and that all was rare and perfected in her: The other two Ladies were two perſons very witty and handſome, the one had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of luſtre and fire than the othea; but this in exchange had ſomething more of ſincerity, which thing hath rendred her alſo a more particular Friend to the Abbeſs her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. I diſcourſed for ſometime with theſe three Nuns upon matters almoſt indifferent, where I endeavoured to produce what wit I could; they for their parts did miracles to ſuſtain the Converſation, eſpecially the Abbeſs her Siſter; this charming Maid ſaid nothing but what I thought ſo particular and clear, that I believed there was but her in the world that had ſo much wit, and that knew how to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150024:43"/>
turn it in ſo admirable a manner; the Abbeſs at length re-entred: and truly in good time if ſhe had the leaſt deſire to conſerve what ſhe had won of me, for to tell you the things as they hapned; the merit of her Siſter ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med too great to me than to dare to give her leſs than a heart; and I was juſt upon changing my mind as ſhe fore-told me: I had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured indeed if her preſence had not re-kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled the fire, that the firſt ſight of her had excited in my Soul: Her Siſter did neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs prevent the farther progreſs; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to you were it not for her, I ſhould have loved the Abbeſs very well; all my eſteem was in her divided, and tenderneſs had followed this eſteem if I had ſeen her firſt; and if her Siſter had not ſeized upon the better part of my heart. I left not the Parlour almoſt all that day, but converſed ſometimes with one, and ſometimes with the other of theſe two aimable perſons: inſomuch that theſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of acquaintance increaſed ſo much in tenderneſs through the ſucceſſion of time, that I may in truth ſay, that I never loved any thing like them. I believe the company don't deſire that I ſhould make too long a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal of this adventure, nor that I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite every ſmall circumſtance: Go on with your ſtory anſwered the Lady <hi>Sindal,</hi> who ſpoke for all the company; we will not have you omit any particular that may be of any
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:150024:43"/>
ſmall conſequence; and you muſt uſe as much fidelity in your relation, as gallantry. We may permit him (added the Dutcheſs) to omit a great many ſmall circumſtances which he may relate to us at other times, for we have now no remainder of time. I would continued the ſaid Lady in ſpeaking to the Cavalier) have a little knowledg how and with what air you managed your affairs with theſe two Ladies, and being as you ſay, in what manner they could ſuffer this diviſion; for I have ever thought it a thing very difficult to deceive two Miſtreſſes, with much more reaſon two Siſters, which you almoſt alwaies ſee toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I'll tell you (anſwered the Cavalier) what hath hapned to me in a Year and a halfs time, in which I had the honour of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; for the firſt time of my ſeeing them was but a day and a half; but there was cauſe enough left behind for my ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and to tell you in a word, all the time of my abode in this Province, I ever left them the later, but it was to return the ſooner: At firſt I would conſult with my ſelf about the different ſentiments I had for the one and the other; and I found (at leaſt it ſeemed to me) that I loved the Abbeſs, and that I had a very great eſteem, and a very tender Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for the other; and although it be not ordinary, yet it is true, that being charmed with the Beauty and Mildneſs of the firſt, I
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:150024:44"/>
was in the ſame inſtant powerfully concerned at the rare merit of the other, and had for her a ſtrange longing to ſee her even in the preſence of the Abbeſs. I needed not to have over-ſtudied my actions yet, if there were any one of them remarkable in favour of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Younger would attribute it to the Quality ſhe had above her; and the Elder wou d take for gallantry of wit all the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging language I paſſed upon her Siſter: it is true, that this ſimple Error could not long continue; the more we love, the clearer is our eye-ſight: inſomuch that both of them having taken a little eſteem for me which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had not, they then began to miſtruſt one another, and to regard my actions, and examine my words with a deeper conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then before they did; ſometimes one would tell me that I praiſed her Siſter with a certain Exageration proper to nothing but love; the other would reproach me that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſought the company of the Abbeſs, and that I was ſeldom in a good humor, but in her Converſation. All theſe uſual complaints are but the Overtures of a clearing Evidence; it muſt appear after a great many windings, and you ſhall hear in what manner. The Abbeſs her Siſter, who if you pleaſe we will call <hi>Egi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> was the laſt that put the queſtion, who proſpered the better; however ſhe ſought the opportunity of a particular converſe with me,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150024:44"/>
which ſhe found in a time when her Siſter was buſied about ſome affairs elſe-where, from which ſhe knew ſhe could not be diſpenſed; and looking upon me with the tendereſt look that Love could paint out, or delineate in a Viſage apt to receive its impreſſion.</p>
               <p>Sir, <hi>Cavalier ſaid ſhe; it is no longer time now to diſſemble with you in any thing: you want not wit, and you know but too well that you are not indifferent to me, theſe five or ſix moneths have I ſeen you? I never was yet ſo poſitive with you upon this matter, but now I'll do more for you than you can expect from a Maid of my humor. It is to aſsure you that the esteem and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs buried in the Cabinet of my Breaſt for your ſake is none of the ſmallest; if you know me you will find that a declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this manner is no trifle; and if you do owe me any ſmall Obligation, it is for having told you what I might have layen hid in the obſcurity of my heart all my life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe joyful Raptures, where the effects of the Grace ſhe did me did lift me her hand I ſaluted, (not knowing how to forbear) a thouſand times, and teſtifying by the acceſs of my joy, even to what point of happineſs, I
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:150024:45"/>
conſidered a declaration ſo charming and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable had brought me. But ſhe interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me, bid me in retiring her hand let her make an end, ſaying it was yet no time for me to anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If you believe,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that the favour I did you in opening my heart to you meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth any acknowledgment from you, let me know in permitting me to look into yours, what I am going to demand of you: You are a perſon of Honour, and it would be too low-ſpirited a thing of you to deceive people, eſpecially thoſe that have both eſteem and friendſhip for you. It is not now that I perceive Madam the Abbeſs to have ſome inclinations for you, ſhe doth not hide her thoughts from me, becauſe ſhe knoweth not that I have the like Sore: But ſhe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not that you love another perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides her, and if I may believe your eyes, your heart hath not a little Intelligence with hers; tell me, and tell me truly; Do you ſincerely love her? to the end that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any further progreſs, I may Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to her in the moment I now ſpeak to You. All that I have that tendeth towards You.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:150024:45"/>I have ſtill ſo much reaſon in me as to render Juſtice to my Rival, if you would have me call her ſo; and to acknowledg that ſhe doth very well merit your whole heart; ſhe is too miſtruſtful, and too well perſwaded of her own worth, to permit you to divide your heart with another; and to ſpeak the truth, although I am her youngeſt Siſter, I am ſo jealous of theſe ſort of Treaſures when I have them once in my poſſeſſion, that it would be no little trouble to me to ſurrender up that place to her wherein I ſhould be eſtabliſhed. Conſult a little, and — Madam, (ſaid I to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting her) not being able to contain my ſelf any longer from not anſwering her, I had not need to conſult any more It is not two dayes ſince I explained my intents to your Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, would the hand underſtand me. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that her good Nature and Civility hath engaged me in many things which I rob from you; but if I muſt pay theſe Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I owe her with a heart, believe me, I were the moſt ingratefull of all men: and that I have given it to you in ſuch manner, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be ſeparated be it for who it will: it was on <hi>Thursday</hi> in the evening when you were in the Garden, that ſhe took occaſion to tell me there was no more then one ſtep wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to gain the entire poſſeſſion of her heart, which was to break with you. What mean you by this Propoſition Madam (ſaid I) being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:150024:46"/>
at what ſhe ſaid: Will you be ſo unjuſt as to make me buy your heart with ſuch baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Can I my ſelf be ſo weak as to obey you? you will pardon me if you pleaſe: But I believe it is not in earneſt you would make me thus criminal. I underſtand you anſwered ſhe preſently, and I perceived the fault that my imprudence had made me commit; you do not eſteem my heart at ſuch a rate as to engage you in a loſs like that of my Siſters; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, do you know the ſentiments ſhe hath for you, and is there any one that poſſeſſeth what you may pretend of her eſteem? I know not Madam, (anſwered I) what paſſeth in your Siſters heart; but in ſine, I never received any thing from her but Honour; and I ſhould be the ſorrowfulleſt man alive if I had given her the leaſt occaſion of repentance; however you muſt reſolve replied ſhe with a coy and diſdainful look, or think never to pretend any thing in my heart, I'll not reſign it, but on thoſe terms; after theſe words I endeavoured to explain my ſelf to her all at length, becauſe I would not give her any more cauſe to doubt of the inward paſſages of my heart; but ſhe left me without ſo much as giving me the leiſure to anſwer her in giving me the longer time of thinking. Thus continued I in ſpeaking to <hi>Egidia:</hi> this Converſation paſſed, whether it be that She would find me alone, or that ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>rehended me too ſoon, knowing of what ſhe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:150024:46"/>
would be ignorant of. The Lady Abbeſs hath not ſpoke any more to me of any thing, to tell you the truth, I thought her Fair; her charms ſurprized my tenderneſs in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and what for her I ſuffer, a true friend is not unworthy of, that ranck I cannot refuſe her; and if you ſhould order me to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I could not do otherwiſe. This char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Lady did ſo rejoice at the ſincerity with which I ſpoke to her, and at what had paſſed between her Siſter and me, that ſhe willingly conſented at that part of my Friendſhip I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon her Eldeſt Siſter, and believed that being aſſured of enjoying my heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, it would but ill become her to ask more: We left one another with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and more love, at leaſt on my behalf. This ſweet tenderneſs I had for her at firſt, had already taken the forme of a very ſtrong paſſion; and this paſſion increaſed daily, while the love in which I firſt ſcorched, for the Abbeſs was half diminiſhed unexpectedly; this ſo obliging and tender confirmation which <hi>Egidia</hi> had manifeſted to me of her love I thought ſo charming, that by this means ſhe finiſhed her Conqueſt in ſubduing the remainder of my heart, and hath left for her Siſter only ſo much as could make me ſay I I did not hate her, neither did I look upon her more than as a Friend whom I had a deſire to conſerve, and to whom I owed ſome
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:150024:47"/>
Obligation; ſhe perceived it preſently, and whether ſhe found out ſome alteration in me by my behaviour towards her, or whether ſhe apprehended her Siſter ſince the time I had told her; I perceived that ſhe took very great notice of all my actions, and that ſhe had not that confidence in me as formerly ſhe had been accuſtomed to have, ſhe took pleaſure even not to believe me any more in whatever I ſaid to her; but with her Siſter it was not ſo: However, jealous ſhe was of her, nothing was viſible, and ſhe would mention me to her as one whoſe heart ſhe feared not the loſs of; ſhe would ſometimes cauſe her ſelf to caſt Jeſts upon her, when ſhe would endeavour to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for her ſake, in telling her the care ſhe took was unprofitable: So that at laſt one day when <hi>Egidia</hi> was troubled that her Siſter would by all outward circumſtances bear the Conqueſt from her, when ſhe knew ſhe had no reaſon for it, told her that it ſignified lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to her to make a Trophy of a heart which ſhe ſo illy kept, and that others perhaps poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed in a better ma ner than ſhe. I believe anſwered her the Abbeſs with a voice no leſs ſcornful, than full of diſdain, to have ſo good a part in it, that it were folly for any one to diſpute it with me, or if they did, it were in vain if they dared to do it. <hi>Egidia</hi> wanted no reply: And this difference went ſo far, that they not being capable of being Judges where
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:150024:47"/>
they were parties, they were content with a common conſent, ſince they could not read thoſe Characters that are writ upon the heart to refer themſelves to what I ſhould ſay, and to engage me to explain my ſelf before them in ſuch manner, that ſhe that found the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt uſage, would willingly ſacrifice her inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in me to the other. I imagine that this converſation had ſomething very ſingular in it, &amp; that there was pleaſure great enough for one to have heard them: this reſolution being made, <hi>Egidia,</hi> who was a prudent Lady, and who ſaw in what ſhe had engaged her ſelf, would have been glad to have revoked it, and would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have renounced all the Joy ſhe could have promiſed her ſelf in ſuch a Victory, for ſhe was in very good hopes of obtaining it, than to expoſe me to the trouble than this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration would cauſe; wherefore the ſame day ſhe writ theſe Lines to me.</p>

               <p>I gave this anſwer to the Lacquey that brought me the Note, and in the ſame inſtant bid my Valett do all things in ſuch good order, and without any noiſe, that we might if it were neceſſary be ready to depart juſt after Dinner. I paſſed the reſt of the morning in the Garden, where while I waited for Dinner, I was meditating on the Queſtion they were preparing to ask me. I omitted telling of you in the beginning, that this is one of thoſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents where the Religious enjoy a civil Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and where their Parents or particular Friends have the permiſſion to enter, and ſee them in their Lodgings, which is a moſt ſweet Commodity for Gallants to paſs for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friends, it being indecent for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious to permit declared Lovers without a ſcruple <hi>I</hi> dined with the Abbeſs as I ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily did, and appeared very much caſt down
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:150024:49"/>
and Melancholy at the Table, contrary to my uſual cuſtome; for commonly I uſed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the company with much delight, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom failed of that heat that giveth the beſt reliſh to a Re-paſt: The two intereſſed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were the firſt that obſerved me. The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs began to diſcourſe very obligingly to me, to put me into a better humor; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I made her no anſwer, ſhe at laſt asked me what I ailed that I appeared ſo dull? I told her it was a great pain in my head that I had been taken with ever ſince the morning; ſhe had neglected nothing this day to ſet her off, and although the Ornaments of the Religious are almoſt all alike, I acknowledg that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I found in her ſo particular and ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to me, that with her ſweet and winning carriage which ſhe uſed, the reſolution I had taken to break off quite with her, began to perplex me; and had not her Siſter been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhe might perhaps have been enough to have made me revoke it: There was ever two or three more Religious her Friends that commonly dined with us, but after Dinner they abſented themſelves. We needed no body to witneſs the Scene that was to paſs among us three, I mean the Abbeſs, her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and me; for in the humor I was in, it was almoſt a trouble to me to keep my Teeth aſunder. The Abbeſs touched again upon the Melancholy ſhe ſaw in my Viſage, and told
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:150024:49"/>
me that ſhe never ſee me in ſo ill an humor before; and that if I would do her a pleaſure, I ſhould tell her the cauſe of it: I anſwered her as before, that I was troubled with a great pain in my head; but ſuch a ſmall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition would not paſs with her, judging by my eyes that there was ſomething more in it; and ſhe prayed me to relate the truth to hee, adding withall with an air full of aſſurance that I was not before ſuſpicious perſons, and that if there was any thing tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſo far as to relate it, that I might be aſſured that ſhe was a partaker, and that I wronged her in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying her ſo ſmall a ſatisfaction: I believe not ſaid her Siſter (to hinder me from anſwering her) that he hath any thing troubles him more than what he hath ſaid: It is often ſeen ſaid ſhe, that perſons endewed with Wit as is the Cavalier, are ſubject to theſe terrible pains of the Head; and they paſs by theſe evil mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from one extremity to another, I mean from evceſſive Joy to exceſſive Melancholy. You believe Siſter then replied the Abbeſs very coldly, that You know very well the Gentlemans diſtemper, becauſe You take upon You to anſwer for him; in the mean time I'll not imagine it to be what You ſay, but I'll believe no otherwiſe than what he will ſay: However ſaid <hi>Egidia</hi> if he wou'd be adviſed by me, he ſhould not diſcover his pain to any;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:150024:50"/>
                  <hi>I</hi> know it, and it is ſo much the worſe for people that know not how to judge of it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me ſaid the Abbeſs with a malicious ſmile, that if I ſhould ask the knowledg of him, it is not that I am ignorant of it; but it is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſe ſome body; and <hi>I</hi> wonder they will make difficulty of underſtanding the truth now which methinks they have ſo much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to know; I was in the right too much continued ſhe, ſince I ſee ſome repent for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged ſo far. By your leave Ladies ſaid <hi>I</hi> interrupting them on a ſudden, let me alone as I am, let my pain be what it will, and from whence it will, I neither will nor can be cured; if it could be, I would only deſire to ſuffer leſs; for my part ſaid the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs who meddle not with Divination, and who do not penetrate ſo deeply into Hearts as my Siſter. I would fain deſire him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to us the Nature of this paine; and for my part ſince I am not infected with the Vice of inſenſibility as many people are. I might give him ſome eaſe if it lay in the Circuit of my power. Nothing could be more gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and favourably ſaid on my behalf than this was; and I was juſt now going to anſwer her according to her deſire, had not a ſudden look which <hi>Egidia</hi> caſt upon me put me in mind of my promiſe, which made me ſilent, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to ſay: This admirable Lady per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my trouble, and took up the word ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:150024:50"/>
well for the purpoſe: it is true ſaid ſhe, that there are certain ſorts of Diſtempers that for their recovery the parties afflicted muſt have Recourſe to thoſe perſons that cauſed them; but the Cavaleer is not ſick in ſuch manner; however it is continued ſhe, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg my ſelf ſo ſenſible of all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth him, that I hould not willingly ſuffer him to relate his pain before me, nay though I might be capable of giving him eaſe. For your part Madam ſaid ſhe in ſpeaking to her Siſter, if you are in that mind you may give your ſelf that content; but you ſhall give me leave to retire then if you pleaſe: And after ſhe had ſaid theſe words, ſhe went away; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that I remained alone with the Abbeſs, who thinking ſhe had triumphed, told me with a Joy ſhe had much to do to conceal that ſhe ſaw well that her Siſter had reſigned up my heart ſince ſhe quitted the party, and that it was ſhe that muſt cure my Diſtemper; but that this was not yet all, ſhe would know of my own ſelf after what manner ſhe was eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in this heart, and how much beyond her Siſter, that ſhe had given me time enough to conſider on it, and that one part I muſt take, which was either to deſpair the obtaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of tenderneſs from me or elſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve not to divide a thing which ſhe deſired the entire poſſeſſion of, that ſhe would grant me a ſmall tender eſteem for her Youngeſt Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:150024:51"/>
but for the heart ſhe only muſt have it, and that ſhe knew how to uſe it; after ſhe had ſaid all theſe things with much Gallantry, ſhe was ſilent to hear my anſwer; but I anſwered nothing, and I believe that my ſilence alone ſpoke enough to be underſtood by her, and that ſhe took it as an evil Omen: ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after ſhe ſeeing me prepare to ſpeak as one that had been muſing what to ſpeak, ſhe did it before me to hinder me from explaining my meaning, thinking it would not have been very favourable on her behalf: Oh Heaven! ſaid ſhe, how little reaſon have I to be ſatisfied now? Were I not in an Humor to forgive you every thing, and had I not ſome pity to ſee you thus melancholy: Go into your Chamber, and there repoſe your ſelf, that's all the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake requires: Ill take care that none ſhall trouble you: I retired with this permiſſion, but confuſed like a man that knew not what to ſay; but I was no ſooner got to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber door then ſhe called me back again, and ſaid with an air full of ſweetneſs, Sir Cavaleer, hark you, I will meet you this Evening at Eight in the Arbor that is in the laſt Walk, I ſhall expect you there with one of my Friends; if you love me you will not fail. What do I ſay replied ſhe preſently; if you did not love me you are too gallant to miſs a Rendezvouz that I appoint you; there's nothing that I know of can make you diſpence with it; Adieu
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:150024:51"/>
and do not fail then; in ending theſe words ſhe ſmiled and entred into her Cloſet, there to hide from me a ſmall bluſh which did inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcend her Viſage, but for what I'll not tell you, but in this manner ſaid the Cavaleer, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drd this converſation which I ſo much drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. I believed nevertheleſs that I was rid of this incumbrance better than I did think I ſhould, and that I had avoided very much trouble in not being conſtrained to explain my mind before theſe two Ladies upon the choice my Heart ſhould have made of them. But yet I could not forbear to fear the Evening-meeting I apprehended her deſigne by it, and to be the laſt act of Grace; however ſince I muſt, and ſince I was reſolved to hide nothing from her, through unworthy Equivocations; I thought it better to make uſe of this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion when I ſhould ſee her alone, to disabuſe her wholly, than to ſtay any longer. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Favours I received from her aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented daily and rendred my ingratitude the greater. I determined than upon this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and was the remainder of the day; after Dinner preparing my ſelf for it in my Chamber; they went to Supper a little after ſix of the clock, that they might have the more time to walk in the freſh aire; I ſeemed leſs Melancholy at the Table than I did in the morning. <hi>Egidia</hi> took notice of it, and ſhe who had ſought me a very great while with
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:150024:52"/>
extream patience, for to demand of me how the caſe ſtood with me, and her Siſter judged not well on her own behalf, ſeeing me in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humor; and did effectively believe that I had betrayed her. I took notice how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed ſhe ſeemed, and how little ſhe eat; this thought ſo perplexed her, ſhe had ever her eyes upon the Abbeſs or me, to endeavour to ſurprize our looks, and penetrate into our hearts, to ſee whether we had no intelligence one with another to deceive her; ſhe had not the patience to riſe from the Table with the reſt, but at length upon a light pretence ſhe left us, and retired into her Chamber, from whence ſhe ſent one of her Friends (who quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her ſelf very handſomly of that Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to tell me that ſhe ſtayed to ſpeak with me as ſoon as I had ſupped, I failed not, and took ſo good a time that the Abbeſs who was entertaining two or three Ladies that came to Viſit her, did not in the leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it: I found this Lady in a very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly poſture leauing upon a Table, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently told me that I was not a little obliged to her for having helped me out of trouble at her Coſt, and that ſhe doubted not but her Siſter had reaped the advantage, but that for my ſake ſhe would not repent it; and when it was for my Repoſe, ſhe would ſacrifice all things, even to her heart it ſelf, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuddenly changing her diſcourſe; but
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:150024:52"/>
by what Charme ſaid She? or to ſpeak better, through what engagement hath Madam the Abbeſs rendred You your Jovial humor; for me-thinks you ſeem to be very pleaſant this after-noon: Alas! you were ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly this morning, have You ſome gage of her heart that gives You ſo much Joy, ſpeak Cavaleer, and conceal nothing from me! You have betrayed me, and doubtleſs You knew not how to ſave your ſelf from the hands of my Adverſary, but in this manner. What do You ſay (Madam anſwered I) that I have betrayed You? Is it poſſible that You can have ſuch a ſuſpition? pray vouchſafe to tell me what grounds You have for it? believe if You pleaſe that far from having thought it; I — No, no Cavaleer ſaid ſhe interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me, I ſee well that You know me not: I know better how to Love than You think I do, Your heart I aimed at, and I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doubted whether I ſhould come to the end of my aim in the manner I deſired or no. My Siſter I confeſs hath given me many cauſes of trouble upon this Enterprize, and I have been allarumed at the ſmalleſt caſt of her eye, and a continual trouble hath not let me enjoy in quiet the pleaſure there is to believe when one loveth that one is loved again; but after all theſe aſſaults I begin to be now ſomething perſwaded that it might perhaps endure thus a great while, were it not for the reſolution I
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:150024:53"/>
have taken to make You change: You muſt then Cavaleer (continued ſhe) ſettle your Love wholly upon the Abbeſs, and endeavour to pleaſe none but her; perhaps it will not be ſo troubleſome to you as to me; but however ſhe muſt take this as an Obligation from my hands, and let her know that I was the firſt that ſpoke of it to You, and that intreated you to it. I acknowledg ſaid ſhe (in making a ſign to me that I ſhould not interrupt her) that I find it troubleſome enough to me to loſe you, and that what I do now lies heavier upon me than death it ſelf; however I'll con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it, and if I have any power over You, You will do as I ſay, and will look upon me as no more than one of your good Friends. As ſhe was proceeding to perſwade me to this alteration, ſome few Tears which fell from her Eyes maugre he betrayed her; and I ſaw her ſo ſtrnngely burthened with grief, that my heart was ready to bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I admired in my ſelf at the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of this Lady, and to what extent the Love ſhe had for me would reach that tender paſſion which I diſcovered through the midſt of her Tears, pierced the very bottom of my heart, and made me with facility to determine rather to loſe the light, than to make an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. I alſo made a thouſand Oaths to her, and in the condition wherein I was, not being
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:150024:53"/>
capable of any cold Expreſſion; I expreſſed my ſelf ſo tenderly, that ſhe had no longer a mind to looſe me. I intreated her that this might be the laſt time of her ſpeaking to me of a thing which ſhe neither muſt nor could ever obtain of me, that my heart ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies tend towards her, and that I would break off with Madam the Abbeſs, ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to diſſwade me, and aſſured me that it would but precipitate my ſe f and her too; but it was all ſaid to no purpoſe; and with this deſign in my head I quitted the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, excuſing my ſelf upon ſome ſmall buſineſs I had, for that I ſtayed no longer with her, and told her before I ſlept I would Viſit her again. I would not give her any Notice of my private meeting, leſt knowing the Reſolution I had taken ſhe had not took a Fancy to detain me, and done her endeavour to hinder this meeting; it was already paſt the time that I was to meet her; and the tears of charming <hi>Egidia</hi> had ſo well diſpoſed me to do all things on her behalf, that I died with impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to render that teſtimony of my Love, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had given me that of the tenderneſs and goodneſs of her heart. I was then at the place the Abbeſs appointed, and found her where ſhe expected me with one of her Friends who left us by our ſelves; as ſoon as I came, ſhe told me ſhe began to be weary with ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for me, and that if I had tarried a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:150024:54"/>
longer, ſhe would ſcarce have pardoned me. I believe Madam ſaid I (coldly enough) that I ſhould come at any time in time enough for what you may have to command me: ſhe was very much ſurpriſed at this anſwer after thoſe obliging words with which ſhe accoſted me; ſhe endeavoured to diſſemble it, and without ſticking at my unjuſt coldneſs, ſhe uſed me the ſweet lieſt in the world, there was no engaging art which ſhe did not uſe, no charme with which ſhe ſerved not her ſelf: it is eaſie if a VVoman be but fair, and not indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to You, to find a thouſand charmes in her if ſhe have a deſire to pleaſe. This of whom I ſpeak did preſently preſent to my view the power of her Beauty: This great reſolution which I had taken againſt her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came by little and little if not unprofitable to me, at leaſt very weak; ſhe did rend a thouſand tokens of inward tenderneſs from me without knowing from whence I drew them: it was no more the perſon I would forſake, ſhe had ſuch full poſſeſſion of me in that moment, that I had ſcarce any room left in my thoughts for the idea of amiable <hi>Egidia:</hi> To ſpeak the truth, this Abbeſs was well skilled in the art of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warming a heart when ſhe pleaſed; it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to defend ones ſelf from her: One would think that ſhe had imployed her whole Life in the ſtudy of Charms; the moſt faithful Lovers deſerve to be excuſed at thoſe infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:150024:54"/>
ſhe cauſeth them to commit, for it lies not in the power of man to do his duty when ſhe pleaſeth to ſeduce him. But not to keep you longer in a place where there are too many things to relate: I acknowledg that ſhe is the only perſon that hath made me know my ſelf beſt no one can be aſſured of any thing againſt a Woman that uſeth complaiſance. If this Fair-one was not fully ſatisfied with me, ſhe had alſo but little reaſon to complain. There is one thing which perhaps may ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This poor Lady knew not what to imagine after what I ſaid to her not two hours ſince, and the Oaths I made to her, ſhe had to good an opinion of me to have lightly believed what her Siſter might have old her on another occaſion to my diſadvantage; but in this e could neither doubt nor excuſe me. The Treaſon was too manifeſt, and all things ſtood againſt me; ſhe was at firſt ſhaken with a thouſand different paſſions, ſo much oppreſſion lay upon her at once, that ſhe was no more the ſame perſon, we ſooneſt believe what we fear moſt: The firſt thing ſhe had a mind too was to ſee me, and preſently ſent for me by her Lacquey.

How cruel are theſe moments? what happineſs were it for me to dye alſo, if Heaven would but hear me, and not ſmile at thoſe Evils which Love maketh me ſuffer: I looked upon this Lady as a man immoveable, not having the power to help her, nor to cry out: This weakneſs which took her, and which was no formal Swound in giving her the liberty though but dimly) of her ſight, ſhe ſaw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Face a grief, which ſpoke to her on my behalf, and nothing (as ſhe told me ſince)

By good Fortune there paſſed by in the mean time two Nuns, who ſeeing her in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eion I before told you, they ran towards us, believing that ſome one of thoſe Accidents had hapned to her, which the Nuns are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſubject to, there came more people; and this News raiſed a diſturbance in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; Madam the Abbeſs was one of the firſt that heard it, nevertheleſs ſhe endeavoured nor to run and ſee: for my part I retired as ſoon as I ſaw there was people enough to aſſiſt her, and although the Abbeſs ſent twice or thrice to ſpeak with me; I deſired her to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, and to ſtay till the next morning to tell me her pleaſure. <hi>Egidia</hi> whom they had carried to her Chamber, and who was already come to her ſelf, not ſeeing me by her bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, in a time wherein ſhe believed that if I loved, I would be leaſt abſent from her, ſoftly asked a Maid that waited on her if ſhe knew not where I was: This Maid who ſaw me go into my Chamber at the ſame time that I left her Miſtreſs, and who had ſeen the Tears run down my eyes, made her a faithful deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, which did extreamly trouble her; and ſhe entreated her Siſter who was ſet down

ſhe in claſping my hand, don't you repent that you have betrayed your beſt of Friends! think well upon what you ſaid to me juſt now! how had you the heart then to deceive me? Speak, are you not the injuſteſt man living? She made a great many more reproaches to me; to which ſhe added a hundred of things which I cannot repeat to you in the manner ſhe ſpoke to me. In a word, to come the ſooner to a ſubject which in the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it to you doth mollifie my inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I juſtified my ſelf to her as well as I poſſibly could, and I confeſſed to her the Rendezvous, and what had obliged me to meet her, and the reaſon I had to conceal it from her, that at length ſhe became well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with me, and mhre courteous than ever before; and ſhe ſhewed me more tokens of tenderneſs than ever I received from her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and thus we moſt agreably acquitted each other from the pain and trouble which we had had this Evening, we never loved better; and this ſmall intervale of time ſerved for nothing but to kindle the fire the more that devoured us; the time was already paſt in which Civility ſhould conſtrain me to retire. I deſired not to enjoy the diſpleaſure of ſtaying till the Abbeſs ſent to me, which ſhe might do: But my ill luck would have it, that all the doors of the Convent being ſhut, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of her Chamber which I muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity

Once again I know not what feebleneſs I received in her preſence, but 'tis certain that ſhe rendred me quite different from what I was before, and that I remembred no more the deſign I had made to forſake her, ſhe was ſo full of Charms that Evening without her Ornaments of Apparel, that in her negligent Garb appeared a thouſand Artifices. I muſt ſay no more to You, except I have a deſire You ſhould think me the greateſt Deceiver and Traytor of all men. I ſtayed more than two

               <p>You may perceive that this Letter was not over-obliging for the Abbeſs, and I ſuppoſe it is not neceſſary for me to tell You how much ſhe was enraged, the ſhame, deſpite, and jealouſie to ſee her ſelf ſo ſlighted by one to whom ſhe had ſhowed ſo many Tokens of her Goodneſs, did at firſt inſpire her with the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elleſt deſignes that ever any Woman was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of; ſhe forſook the Cloſet in a Fury, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt torn all theſe Letters in a thouſand pieces as ſhe would have done my heart; and were it not for a Lady who was one of her Friends, and her Confident in all things, I know not to what point ſhe had brought this her reſentment.</p>
               <p>This Lady who was altogether endued with prudence, adviſed her on this account with good intentions, and endeavoured to bring her to her ſelf again: She told her that ſhe ſhould be careful of her behaviour, and that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:150024:61"/>
the noiſe which ſhe might make upon ſuch a buſineſs could never turn but to her diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and that ſhe ſhould manage her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct according to the rank ſhe held; and that it would be no good example for the other Nuns. But what means is there to digeſt ſo cruel an affront? All that this good Lady could obtain of her was, that ſhe would not ſee me all that day for to have the more time to conſider what ſhe had beſt to do. <hi>Egidia</hi> returned after her Walke, and entring into her Cloſet, ſhe found all things diſordered, and the Letters in the condition before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; the pleaſure of Revenge which in a VVomans mind is the greateſt living, made her to taſte (upon this occaſion) contentments, which to comprehend, you muſt be VVoman and Lover together, ſhe could not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue before ſhe had declared to me all this Adventure, for which ſhe rejoyced, as think<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing it a good part ſhe had played, ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured however to prepare my ſelf to hear the News without anger, and calling me into her Chamber, ſhe asked me my Opinion, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe had ſpoiled my deſigns with her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? I anſwered her that on condition ſhe was not too much concerned her ſelf, I took it not illy. At length ſhe related to me the effects of her Siſters Jealouſie and ſhowed me in what condition my Letters and Notes were; I ſeemed to take little notice of any thing,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:150024:61"/>
but in truth I approved not her Conduct, and when I came to make reflexion upon all that I had writ to her, I could have been glad if ſhe had made uſe of another meanes, and that her revenge had taken up other weapons: I doubted not but that the Abbeſs was in a ſtrange paſſion, and that this buſineſs would produce ſome ill conſequence, in which <hi>Egi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> would be the firſt that ſhould ſuffer. I could not refrain from ſaying ſomething to her, and aſſured her nevertheleſs that I would not in any-wiſe contradict her pleaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her will was ſo bent, but that knowing ſo well as I did her Siſters humor, all I feared was from her behaviour, and that ſhe ſought not ſome way to revenge this upon me. I ſpoke this to her in a way tender enough; however <hi>Egidia</hi> did not take it ſo, but looking on me with a ſpiteful ſmile, I ſee ſaid ſhe what it is that allarms you, and that I have not uſed you well: Go Sir Cavaleee ſaid ſhe in riſing from her place to be gone, go caſt your ſelf at her feet, and ſwear to her that you adore her, and ask her pardon for all that you have writ to me. I Madam (anſwered I her!) will you forſake me thus! and thus diſown my Heart! Ah give me leave if you pleaſe to tell you, that you know me but too illy, and that I am ready to avouch to her all that I have of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in my breaſt for you. Obſerve, if you pleaſe require of me the greateſt token of my
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:150024:62"/>
Love, You may, and I will give You the whole day for You to take this pleaſure in, for to morrow I ſhall be gone, and you ſhall ſee how little I will be concerned whether I be well or ill with the Lady your Siſter; this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo ſuddenly taken, did a little ſurprize <hi>Egidia,</hi> and ſhe was troubled that ſhe had proceeded thus far, ſhe embraced me tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and did what ſhe could to cauſe me to change my deſign, but with much trouble, and I left her at length without promiſing her any thing very ſure: The reſt of the day I ſpent in conſidering what I ſhould reſolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; all things perplexed me, and I could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern no better way than to be gone. But one thing which I found very difficult was, how I ſhould take my leave of the Abbeſs, which was a duty I could not well omit: I muſt do it, and I took my time when ſhe had moſt compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with her, to avoid a number of evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches which I knew ſhe would not do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore witneſſes. I went then towards the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to her apartment, and asked the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous whom I met, and whom doubt eſs they had ſent before me, if I could not obtain the Honour as to Viſit Madam the Abbeſs: She preſently anſwered me no, and that ſhe was ſomething indiſpoſed: But having once again made me ſome inſtance for that; ſhe whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me ſoftly in the ear, and told me that this Order was given expreſly for me, and that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:150024:62"/>
therefore as a Friend ſhe counſelled me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. I confeſs that this adventure did not ſo much ſurprize me as it would have done had I not prepared my ſelf from being kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by her; but yet it is true that I reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome deſpite in my heart for this refuſal, and that I had not been comforted but by the meanes I obtained to acquit my ſelf in another manner of the reſpect I owed her; it wa by writing I would take my Farewell; and ſee here in proper termes the Letter I ſent her.</p>

Lady ſo ſorrowful and changed, that it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to move the moſt barbarous heart. I know not how I found my ſelf then, but truly I could not enjoy my ſelf, and the confuſion wherein the ſight of her put me is not to be expreſſed.

I knew not what to ſay to her, I feared that whatever I ſaid ſhe would take for new infidelities in the trouble I was in to ſee her in this condition: Nevertheleſs, ſince it is no difficult thing to appeaſe a perſon that loveth us, and deſireth to be loved, I brought my ſelf at length to overcome her anger, and left her not till I ſaw her in a condition to forgive me all. I will tell You what cauſed her to be ſo ſoon won; ſhe had a deſire to ſtay me, and it was no pollicie for her to uſe me rigorouſly, I was not yet ſo indifferent to her, but that ſhe thought it troubleſome to forſake me quite; ſhe did not ſo much as doubt (as in Love we often flatter our ſelves, but one day to bear away the Conqueſt from her Siſter, ſhe knew not that my Journey was but for two or three dayes; ſhe believed I would be gone in earneſt, and I did her an Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I entreated her to permit me at leaſt to mae a ſmall Jorney into the Neighbouring

Village; to which ſhe conſented ſo much the more willingly, becauſe ſhe had no deſire to to have notice taken how eaſily ſhe was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to her ſelf again after ſo manifeſt an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; ſhe was glad to make uſe of ſome meanes whereby to hide her weakneſs, and to make the world believe that ſhe was not appeaſed but in proceſs of time; ſhe required of me more eſpecially, that I would not acquaint her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with our reconciliation, and that I would in no wiſe ſee her in parting, if I would not give her cauſe to repent for the too great indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſhe had over me; I promiſed to grant her deſire, and although <hi>Egidia</hi> had ſent to tell me that ſhe would ſpeak with me; I begg'd of her by one of her Friends, that ſhe would diſpence with me for ſome reaſons which I would write her, and with which I was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe would reſt ſatisfied; to ſpeak the truth I owed this ſatisfaction to a perſon to whom I was ſo much Obliged, and who had ſo much reaſon to complain of me: I departed then, and went to ſee this Friend, from whence I writ many Letters to theſe Ladies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived alſo many from them in the laſt which the Abbeſs ſent me, ſhe entreated me to meet her the day following in the ſame Arbor I ſaw her in before, and that it ſhould be in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, eſpecially that her Siſter might not know it in the leaſt, and that ſhe would be there at Nine of the Clock, and would ſtay for me till
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:150024:65"/>
Eleven a clock, I clearly ſaw by this Letter that the Abbeſs was appeaſed, and that ſhe was merrily enclined, I believed I could not handſomly refuſe it, and that I muſt by Policy in Love advertize her Siſter of it, becauſe ſhe might not complain of me if it came to her knowledg as in the laſt Rendezvous. I anſwered the Abbeſs then that I would not fail to be there at Nine according to her appointment; and this is the Letter I wrote to her Siſter.</p>

not have given it to her more privately as I had inſtructed him. The Abbeſs after ſhe had taken the Letter, ſent my Man away again, and told him that if it were requiſite, ſhe would ſend an anſwer. We may with eaſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how great her impatience was to ſee what I had writ to her Siſter; but it were hard to tell you all the trouble ſhe reſented after ſhe had ſatisfied her Curioſity; ſhe was not naturally of a bad humor; and had not Jealouſie intermixed, ſhe might perhaps have contented her ſelf with converting her Choler into injuries: But this paſſion is not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to uſe ſuch weak ſorts of Revenge, it carrieth its deſign even to an extremity, and injured Love is the terribleſt of Enemies; the Abbeſs went to ſeek her Siſter, whom ſhe found in her Chamber, and as it is common for them to talk of me, it was eaſie for her; after a ſmall winding of their diſcourſe to make me the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it: Let us acknowledg after all, Siſter ſaid the Abbeſs after ſhe had ſpoken very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently of me, that we are both very much deceived in thoſe advantageous Opinions which we have had of this Gentleman, who hath payed all thoſe tokens of good will he hath received from us both with no hing but Treaſons: For my part added ſhe, I am now undeceived enough; and truly part of this Obligation I owe to you, for had it not been for thoſe Letters I found in your Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,

I might yet have been in ſo ſtrange an error: If you deſire I ſhould render you in exchange the like ſervice: But dear Siſter, You are ſo much for his advantage, that you will ever believe let me ſay what I will, that there can be nothing more Civil nor faithful then what he telleth you: VVhat is it you will do? anſwered her <hi>Egidia</hi> coldly: I ſee not the Cavaleer do any thing to be eſteemed cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, but whereby I may ſee that he hath a great reſpect for me, and I have even Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the contrary, I am too juſt to ever change that good Opinion I have of him. But ſuppoſe I ſhould make you to ſee ſaid the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs to her, that you are deceived in your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and that he betrayeth you, and that he is the baſeſt of men, I ſhould perhaps (procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhe) not have all that acknowledgment that ſuch a piece of ſervice meriteth; for not to ſpeak falſely to you, although common y we take but little pleaſure to be deceived; I confeſs my weakneſs in this, that I love better to continue in my error; an evil is no evil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we feel it and know it; and if in ſome certain things I might have my choice, the ſweeteſt for me would be to remain in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. How you are to be pitied replied again the Abbeſs, and how little you deſerve to be undeceived: But you are my Siſter, and I muſt in ſpite of you your ſelf have pity on You. Know then that this civil Gentleman,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:150024:67"/>
this faithful Friend, how you will be pleaſed to call him, gave me notice by a Letter whic he wrote me this day to meet him this evening in the Garden, and entreated me as much as he could to let it be in private, and that you might know nothing: If You pleaſe You may not believe me continued ſhe (who ſaw her Countenance begin to be troubled, and that her colour changed three or four times) or rather it is but your going with me to give you cauſe to believe your own eyes. How ſtedfaſt ſoever this amiable Lady was, this blow cauſed her to reel; the Infidelity was manifeſt, and her Rival aſſured her of the thing ſo poſitively that ſhe could have no cauſe of doubt, ſince ſhe offered to conduct her to the Rendezvous to be her ſelf a witneſs; ſhe agrees to walk with her to the Garden, ſhe gives her a Sword to kill herſelf, and ſhe will not ſtay a moment from ſeeing her death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was now their time to go.</p>
               <p>But all this time ſayd the Cavaleer (in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his diſcourſe) while I amuſe my ſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with too much pleaſure to relate to you a ſtory, where the greateſt part of Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſeem to flatter me; I do not conſider that it doth but abuſe peoples patience; You ought not to imagine thus ſaid the Lady <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> for till now no Body hath taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to Interrupt You, and the ſilence the Company hath lent You, is a viſible Evidence
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:150024:68"/>
that they are not yet weary of hearing you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all theſe Gallantries. I acknowledg con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe in ſmiling, that I have often ſaid to my ſelf, that there was but one man like you to whom one might pardon ſo much vanity, and who might have the confidence to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain us with a Hiſtory of which he is the Hero. You requite but Illy (anſwered her the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leer) the Obedience I have ſhown You in this thing for whatever You are pleaſed to ſay; Madam, never before this time had I the good Fortune to relate my Adventures; here is no Body here replyed the ſame Lady but who knoweth you, and have learned even from your own lips a great part of the Tranſactions of your Life. Notwithſtanding I doubt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much proceeded ſhe whether or no all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as you ſay. If that be your thought Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam replied the Cavaleer to her, and if the reſt of the Company be no more favourable to me, it was in vain that I took ſo much trouble upon me; this Opinion is an advantage to me, and I hope they will diſpence with me from u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any more ſuperfluous diſcourſes, we may find ſomething better for the Converſation. The Dutcheſs who was laughing with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ladies to ſee the Cavaleer half defeated for what Madam <hi>Sindal</hi> had ſaid to him, would have the Raillery go no further when ſhe heard him ſpeak to that intent, and told him that ſhe pretended not to have liſtned to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:150024:68"/>
him thus long, but to know this Hiſtory even to the end: She added further, that he ſhould not be concerned for what the Lady <hi>Sindal</hi> ſaid to him, and that if there was any thing to be blamed in what he had related, it was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly the conduct of theſe Religious Ladies. But that it is not now known to be the firſt time that Love dreſſed himſelf in all ſorts of faſhions, and was of all conditions, and that a man found no better delight than in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of theſe Ladies.</p>
               <p>She prayed then the Cavaleer to make an end, the Company alſo began to urge him to it; he refuſed, and told them it was now time to retire, and that he had yet behind too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to relate: They judged it then more proper to defer the reſt till the next day, and paſs the time away with ſome Recreation. But the Cavaleer anſwered to that, that it were not neceſſary for them to ſeek any thing that could divert them more than the Letters they had propoſed to read, and that they could not without injuſtice favour others more than they had done him. Madam the Dutcheſs told him that if all had a Hiſtory like his, they would be long a reading; but nevertheleſs for ſatisfaction ſhe ſhould have two read, after which the Converſation ſhould end; and the other Letters ſhould be returned to their Owners.

               <p>There was none of the Company but was ſurprized at this Letter, and who could believe that ſuch a Letter might have been writ to a Lady ſo wiſe and reaſonable as was Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle <hi>d'Armand;</hi> Madam <hi>d'Elus</hi> who knew her well, would not believe her eye-ſight, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her twice or thrice if it were to her they ſent this Letter, and whether they were not miſtaken? This Lady did but laugh at their wonder; but however from bluſhing ſhe could not abſtain, becauſe every ones eyes was on her.

and that the Gallantries that they write to you, gives us cauſe enough of thinking; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is anſwered ſhe him, it is from too gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant a man I receive them to cauſe my diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and I am at all times ready to ſend him more tender ones. If we knew You not ſaid the Counteſs <hi>d'Ancyce,</hi> we would interpret the things litterally, and ſhow you little Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; but I believe there is a myſtery in this Letter, and that You are not willing to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Honour your ſelf in the manner it is turned; for my part ſaid the Dutcheſs, I comprehend nothing, and I confeſs that I want as great an eſteem as I have for Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armand</hi> not to condemn her, but tell us however continued ſhe in addreſſing her ſelf to that Lady what You ſmile at? and what there is we underſtand not in this Letter? for I have no mind to change the Opinion I have of You.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:150024:70"/>
a man to ſay he loved, than for a Lady to ſuffer it; and that the Baron <hi>d'Eſtall</hi> (who was Author of this Letter) having undertook the contrary, the company thought fit that for the rarity of the act, that the Baron ſhould repreſent the perſon of a Miſtreſs, and ſhe, that of the Lover, that they might have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſeeing how this buſineſs would paſs; ſhe aſſured them that this Gallantry had given way to ſuch witty things as well in Proſe as Verſe, that thouſands of Perſons have been divertized by it, and that ſhe did alſo in the like manner; ſo that this Letter muſt not be read as coming from a Gallant, but as from a ſenſible Miſtreſs, and that the truth was, that they both of them had ill repreſented their Pe ſonages, becauſe that the Baron had too ſoon ſubmitted himſelf; and that for he part ſhe did not uſe thoſe Cares and Endeavours as paſſionate Lovers uſe. The Cavaleer would willingly that Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armand</hi> had not juſtified her ſelf ſo well, and that they had but doubted of what ſhe ſaid: But the reſt of the Company had too good thoughts of her, not to render her that Juſtice as was her due: They found this Gallantry very pleaſing and capable of giving much diverſion: They enlarged no further upon this to obtain time for the reading the other Letter, but before they read them the Dutcheſs pulled this Song out of her pocket, and gave it to Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle

                     <p>You would know whether ajealous man may be termed a Lover? Whence jealouſie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds? and what difference there is in matter of Love between Fear and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:150024:73"/>I Firſt must tell You, that I believe not that a Jealous Man Loveth; but on the contrary ſay, that he hateth with a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hatred, as it is eaſie to diſcern by his Actions; and therefore it were very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to give him the title of Lover, ſince he deſerveth it not. I muſt according to the Order of things, Firſt tell You whence jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie ſpringeth: For my part it is my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that a man is not Jealous; but then when he believeth himſelf unworthy to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the Eſteem of his Miſtreſs: And I dare my Self believe that one that is Jealous, doth not imagine himſelf Loved, for elſe he would not afflict himſelf as he doth: 'Tis folly to ſay as many do, that this Viper Love is but a meer Fear to loſe what one Loveth; a Jealous man would proceed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another faſhion: Fear is an unproffita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Paſſion which truly moleſteth the Soul, and cauſeth it to apprehend the Evils that may diſturb him; but it never bringeth a man into deſpair, as doth Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie; becauſe that it breedeth in us thſe things which may come to paſs, and yet not happen neither. A fearful man doth not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:150024:73"/>
altogether loſe his hope he endeavours to prevent by all the meanes poſſible the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes which he apprehendeth, to the end he may eſcape the ſtorm. I ſay further, that the Fear in Love is a ſort of Vertue between the two extreams; it is eaſily diſcerned that Jealous men are not poſſeſſed with this Fear, but rather with a Rage, which cauſeth them to believe that they have abſolutely loſt what they adored; let us but take the pains to examine one of theſe Fools we ſhall ſee that he acteth not like a man that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, nor like a Lover that deſireth to be loved, but like a deſperate and declared Enemy. Every one naturally hateth that which giveth them diſpleaſure; and what greater diſpleaſure can one imagine than to think ones ſelf forſaken and ſlighted by that which one eſteemeth and loveth more than Ones life: A Jealous man who is perſwaded that he is thus evilly treated by his Mistreſs cannot love her more; hatred muſt ſucceed this love, and oftentimes Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: What trouble to this unhappy man in the time of this alteration? What Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat is there in his mind? I believe there is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:150024:74"/>
nothing more terrible, and that the leaſt Councel his mind ſuggeſts to him, is to have recourſe to death. When Love is once departed from the heart of a Jealous man (which departeth as I ſaid before) in the moment that Jealouſie is introduced; this last Paſſion doth wholly Occupy him, ruleth him, tyrannizeth over him, and loadeth him with that affliction which alwaies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth it: If You would yet more clearly ſee that there is no Love in the heart of an unfortunate Jealous man, take more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al notice, You ſhall ſee nothing in him but high-carried deſignes, and full of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, he is never contented, he talketh of nothing but death and deſpair; he will loſe all, he calleth her he adored a little before unfaithful and ingrateful, full of Cruelties and Treacheries; and in fine, the leaſt ſuſpition he hath to the diſadvantage of this Fair-one, he maketh a truth of it, and aſsureth it as a thing that he hath ſeen; he ſeeks no more to pleaſe her by his cares, diſcretion, and fidelity, he ſeeketh nothing but her ruine, and acteth in ſuch manner that his Rivals who were perhaps incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:150024:74"/>
of (Raviſhing her from him) profit by his going astray, and endeavour to eſtabliſh themſelves to deſtroy him quite; if his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs endeavour to cauſe his return to her, he taketh all theſe advancements from her for Treaſons, he publiſheth them to let the World ſee that he is not ſo unwiſe as to truſt her; he committeth daily new crimes againſt her without giving any Reaſons wherefore; for which a moment afterwards he repenteth a thouſand times. Pray tell me how a man of this humor can be called Lover; and whether it be the fear he hath to loſe what he loveth that leadeth him to theſe Extremities; for my part I believe it not. If he loved he would uſe other meanes; if it was nought but fear that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested him, he would uſe ſome meanes to re-aſſure himſelf, and not to make him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair: I believe certainly that the first effect of Jealouſie is the laſt ſigh of Love; here is at length my thoughts in the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on You have propoſed; let me next know what Your Opinion is upon which I will govern my ſelf in all things.

               <p>THe Fourth day began by an agreaable ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal; The Dutcheſs had cauſed by the arrival of two of the Faireſt Ladies of the Court; the Counteſs <hi>d'E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mond,</hi> and Madam <hi>d'Eyrac</hi> they had notice that there was a great company at this Ladies; they owed her a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, and were glad to make uſe of that oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity while they were pleaſingly at their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: Monſieur <hi>d'Arignan</hi> was of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and accompanied them in this Viſit; he was a brave wit, and who had a gallant way with him for Converſation, and who fulfilled his duty very well in the Circle; as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany enlarged, ſo the Dutcheſs did augment the expences; if it were poſſible to add any thing to the magnificenſe with which ſhe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her Gueſts. VVe muſt acknowledg that ſince this day it was but a meer profuſion that appeared in the ſmalleſt Collaſions which ſhe gave them in Baſons full of Comfits, in moſt exquiſite Wines, in other Liquors, and in all that a man could wiſh that was moſt delicate. A Ball was their diverſion for ſome part of the afternoon, and if I had undertook to relate all that paſſed in this Houſe, I ſhould have
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:150024:76"/>
ſomewhat to amuſe the Reader from time to time with in particulars that perhaps might not diſpleaſe him; but ſince I am tyed only to the converſations of the Evening, which were kept in the green Arbour, I muſt (not to leave my deſign) refer my ſelf to what they have ſayed. The Dutcheſs who had taken great delight in the Hiſtory of theſe Nuns, and who had a deſire that it might ſerve for this Evenings Converſation, had intreated Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armand</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the two Ladies which were newly come, that which the Cavaleer had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told them: This Damſel acquitted her ſelf faithfully and wittily of her Office, and gave much delight to theſe two Ladies, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to Madam <hi>d'Eyrac,</hi> to whom this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was not unknown, and who conſequently told the Counteſs <hi>d'Ermond</hi> that ſhe knew it; they had no ſooner took their places in the Circle according as they came, but the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs addreſſing her ſelf to the Cavaleer, told him that he muſt make an end of what he began the day before, and that no other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſhould be propoſed, nor any other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime before he had ended the recital of this Adventure; the Cavaleer endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it by a thouſand ſubtleties, and inſtantly entreated the Dutcheſs that ſhe would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with him, and he would not ſubmit at laſt but by compulſion; that which vexed him
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:150024:76"/>
moſt of all was, that the Lady <hi>Sindal,</hi> and Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armand</hi> told him that what he did was only becauſe he deſired intreaties; but however they could not do him a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kindneſs. Notwithſtanding all theſe Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries he muſt proceed in his Hiſtory, he had very many Reaſons not to continue it becauſe of Madam <hi>d'Eyrac,</hi> who was not ignorant of the leaſt circumſtance as he knew very well himſelf. This Lady ſmiled in her heart to ſee the trouble he was in; ſhe had her Eye on him on purpoſe to diſcountenance him; at length he began his diſcourſe at where he had left off, but with ſo great a negligence, and ſo little regard to all what he ſaid, that it was no more the ſame thing, but a weak and light recital, which was nothing like what he had accounted before; there was no Body but perceived it, the Dutcheſs was the firſt that told him that it was pitty to hear him relate it in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that he had not this day the ſame wit as formerly: The other Ladies made him the ſame reproaches, except the Counteſs <hi>d'Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and Madam <hi>d'Eyrac</hi> who took his part; for my part I believe ſaid the firſt of theſe two Ladies with an agreeable ſmile, that the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leer never wanteth wit, but that he yet hath more diſcreſſion, &amp; that is it that obligeth him to touch but lightly upon things which may injure the reputation of a ſort of People whom we ought to reſpect more than others.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:150024:77"/>
And what is this diſcretion anſwered the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Sindal</hi> that he hath not taken care for till to day, and before a company who knoweth not ſo much as of what Countries thoſe are of which he ſpeaketh. I ask your pardon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam replyed the Counteſs <hi>d'Ermond</hi> to her if there were none here Yeſterday that were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with theſe Nuns, there may be to day who can inform you better than he of the particulars of this Hiſtory. Ah Madam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed preſently the Lady <hi>Sindal,</hi> it is you then! I pray tell us what you know in it: The other Ladies made the ſame requeſt to her; but ſhe anſwered that they muſt addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Madam <hi>d'Eyrac,</hi> who was a witneſs of part of theſe Adventures: The Cavaleer was confuſed; the Ladies laughed, and the Dutcheſs told him that inſtead of troubling himſelf, he ought to be glad of this Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of finding ſome body that can relate a Hiſtory which would not ſeem ſo well in his mouth as in anothers: ſhe conſequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged Madam <hi>d'Eyrac</hi> to take upon her the trouble of relating it. This Lady did it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obligingly: ſhe firſt ſmiling asked the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeers permiſſion and ſhe afterwards began in this manner.</p>
               <p>Since the Cavaleer ſaid ſhe hath had the diſcreſſion not to name the perſons of whom he ſpoke; I believe you will not require more of me than you did of him, a thouſand Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:150024:77"/>
forbid it me, and it would be no great addition to the Hiſtory, nor augment the pleaſure in any thing which you will have to hear that which I am going to tell you.</p>
               <p>There is perhaps no Body here but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it is now two Years ſin e the misfortune that hapned upon my Family, which obliged Monſieur <hi>d'Eyrac</hi> my Husband to abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the Court. In this great ſubject of affliction I went to one of my Friends who was a Nun in the Monaſtery of which we ſpeak to ſeek ſuch Conſolation as I might find by a retreat from the ſight of all things that might cauſe any trouble.</p>
               <p>I'll not tell you whether what the Cavaleer hath told you be true or no, becauſe he had known theſe Ladies above a Year when I came thither, and to ſpeak the truth what I have underſtood is not much unlike what he hath related to You, but I will warrant you for the truth of what I ſhall relate to you in what paſſed in my time.</p>
               <p>I was very lovingly received in this Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, there was no civility which the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs ſhewed me not, and every day they would ſtrive who could oblige me moſt, it was almoſt a month that the Cavaleer had not been there. I had heard ſpeak of him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as a very civil Gentleman, for whom the Abbeſs had a great eſteem, and from whom ſhe often received Letters; he came a few
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:150024:78"/>
dayes after me. I preſently perceived that this eſteem had ſomething of much tenderneſs in it, and that this Friendſhip had ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of Love. The Abbeſs who was endued with much goodneſs, and who put much confidence in me, would conceal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from me; ſhe would exceedingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend her Cavaleer to me; ſhe would rank him above the pitch of all men, and would not only have had me to applaud him, but to have judged her not indiſcreet in theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes ſo long as things ſeemed to me not to go too far: I diſſembled, but when I came to know that this friendſhip wrought the ſame effects as Love, and that it excited jealouſie in the two Siſters, that it cauſed ſighings and languiſhings, that they let fall Tears, I could not forbear declaring my thoughts to the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs, and to repreſent to her that this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement might one day do her a prejudice, and that an Amorous affair ought not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Monaſtery. She outwardly ſeemed to take friendly the freedom I uſed to her, but in truth this good adviſe cauſed her to carry her ſelf but more coldly to me; ſhe could have deſired ſomething more of Complaiſance from my Friendſhip, her Diſeaſe being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without remedy, ſhe could have deſired at leaſt that I would have ſupported her in it; this occaſioned my having leſs correſpondence with her, and that I ſaw her no more than by
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:150024:78"/>
duty, becauſe I would not altogether break off with a perſon who hath command where I lived, and to whom I had already been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much Obliged; her Siſter managed it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, ſhe concealed appearances, and although ſhe had no leſs eſteem or tenderneſs for the Cavaleer than the Abbeſs, ſhe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding acted before the world like a Maid almoſt indifferent: She had alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of wit than her Eldeſt Siſter, but not ſo much beauty: I'll begin the recital of theſe Adventures if the Company think it requiſite where the Cavaleer left off Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; for what he hath told You to day is but a feeble Crayon of what You ſhall now hear; It was when his Man had taken the Abbeſs for her Siſter, and when he had gave her the Letter which he ſhould have given to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, into what a rage and fury did this Fair Lover enter when ſhe had ſeen the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Letter; the leaſt thing her paſſion ſuggeſted to her was to be revenged on the Traytor to cauſe him to be killed, a Maid in whom ſhe truſted moſt, and who was too Young to take the liberty to give her adviſe, would come every evening before ſhe went to her reſt, and repeat to me a part of her Follies, at which in truth I did but divert my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: The Abbeſs then as the Cavaleer hath told You brought her Siſter with her to this Rendezvous, where the Gentleman ſailed not
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:150024:79"/>
to be at the hour appointed; his Surprizal was great as we may imagine, to ſee the two Siſters together, after what the Abbeſs had writ to him how ſhe would not have any one know of this Enterview, more eſpecially her Siſter; he alſo remembred what he had writ to the other, and the entreaty he made in the Letter he wrote her, ſhe ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at this aſſignation how nothing ſhould prejudice her, he knew not at length what to believe, and of a thouſand thoughts he had remaining in his Brain in the moment he ſaw theſe Ladies, there was not one which came near the truth, ſo incredible was it to him to imagine that ſuch an accident ſhould befall him in the midſt of that cruel anguiſh that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight and jealouſie made the Abbeſs to ſuffer, ſhe reliſhed a moſt extream joy to ſee the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeers trouble; but her Siſter was filled with nothing but grief for her part, the Violence ſhe uſed to contain her ſelf was the rudeſt thing a heart could endure, ſhe could abide no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger there, ſhe muſt retire, but it was when ſhe had conſidered him from head to foot with a look full of diſdain, choler, and indignation, and without ſpeaking to him: the poor Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver who began to waken out of his firſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal, fell into a ſecond much more cruel when he had ſeen in what manner ſhe looked upon him and had fled from him; I know not ſaid he in ſpeaking to the Abbeſs what I have
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:150024:79"/>
done to your Siſter that in my preſence ſhould cauſe her to flee, I expected not this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor; it is becauſe anſwered him the Abbeſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oldly, we alſo expected not to have ſeen You make ſo quick a return, and becauſe we have little occaſion for You here. Ha! if it be ſo as You ſay Madam replied the Cavaleer to her preſently, I ſwear to You You ſhall not keep me here much longer, for I hate above all to incommode people. But however Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam added he preſently, I hope You will not take it Ill if I go to know of Your Siſter her ſelf if this be the reaſon that Obligeth her to treat me thus: after that I ſhall continue with You no longer time than for to bid You adieu; and in ſaying that he ran towarde the Fair afflicted one whom he overtook juſt as ſhe was entring into the Monaſtery.

Juſt ſo (anſwered him the Abbeſs) all Traytors ought to be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for their perfideouſneſs: It is now no time replied the Cavaleer to her to ask you what reaſon you have to call me by this name, becauſe I muſt now be gone, and deliver you from a man who is more than importunate to you.

you have permitted, and perhaps alſo called your Siſter to come hither, whom you charged me ſo much to keep ignorant of this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view. Yes Traytor! anſwered ſhe him, all overcome by her paſſion, and it is in what thy baſe heart hath failed: Tell me, baſe one? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou didſt not write what I deſired thee to conceal? The Cavaleer was ſo ſtrangely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at this, that he remained confuſed, and did effectively believe that his Miſtreſs had revealed the Letter he had ſent her. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs not to fall into a greater confuſion; if it ſhould come to a clearer Evidence, he would break off upon this occaſion: I know not very well Madam ſaid he to her very uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedly what it is you mean: but if all theſe reproaches, and all theſe injuries tend only to drive me from hence, I aſſure you you give your ſelf a trouble without cauſe, and that there need not ſo much to deprive me of the deſire of ever ſetting my foot here again. I am going to take my leave of You continued he in going to leave her, and Madam Farewell for ever. The Abbeſs ſtayed him, and told him after ſhe had become ſomething milder, that whatever reaſon they had to act (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though) worſe with him than yet they had done, they would not let him go at the hour it was. Whether You have reaſon or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Cavaleer to her abruptly, I am ſo little accuſtomed to be received thus wherever

I go, that I very impatiently can bear all the minutes I abide here to get out of the trouble I am in: I pray Madam permit me proceeded he in endeavouring to get looſe from her, to make uſe of the time that yet remains: But I will not let You go to night ſaid the Abbeſs to him, and if You think I have yet ſome power over You to oblige You to do any thing for my ſake, You will make it appear in this I have ſomewhat to ſay to You, and it will be time enough to morrow to do your pleaſure. The Cavaleer prayed her not to ſtay any longer if ſhe had any thing to ſay to him, and that on any other occaſion he would te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie to her the reſpect he had for her, but that he could in no wiſe ſtay. We will ſee that ſaid ſhe, and they ſeparated the one from the other in this manner. The Abbeſs was like thoſe unfortunate Lovers who in their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires know not what they would have; ſhe who but a moment before would have been glad not only to baniſh the Cavaleer from her preſence, but to ruine him, had not the power to ſee him leave her. What a weak thing is Choler againſt an Object that hath known how to charm us: How illy can a heart be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on what it loveth?

No, no, if You think good proceeded ſhe with a bluſh that overſpread her whole Viſage, we will not differ ſo much in our revenge on him, thou art enough to execute the deſign; if thou haſt the courage to follow me, we will find out this perfide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man who is but a ſmall league from hence, and thou ſhalt ſee to what a height I will ſerue the thing, and if a man can be loaded with Injuries and Reproaches, I proteſt to You that he ſhall. So bold a Propoſition at firſt did ſtrangely ſurprize this Maid; ſhe who was afraid to walk in the Night about the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery without a light, could not but think this a thing too dangerous and full of horror, to dare to expoſe them two alone at that hour to the troubleſome accidents of a great high way: But the Abbeſs knew how to repreſent this Enterprize ſo ſure and eaſie to her, and ſo uncapable of any ill rencounter in that little way they were to go, and in ſo fine a Night, that at length ſhe over-perſwaded her, and made her to Love even a Novelty: The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs extreamly rejoycing for having o'recome her dear Companion, thought on nothing more than getting of Horſes, ſhe would not uſe her own becauſe of going forth privatly, ſhe choſe rather to have recourſe to her Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:150024:83"/>
to let her have three Horſes, and not to fail to ſend them the ſame Evening; the man went immediatly, and left the Ladies who were preparing themſelves to get on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; the firſt thing the Abbeſs did was to give out that ſhe was ſomething indiſpoſed, and that ſhe would go to her bed; ſhe took her leave of thoſe that ſerved her, and had none remaining with her but her dear Companion, as ſhe had formerly; as ſoon as they were by themſelves, they began to undreſs them to put on their riding apparel; thoſe of the Abbeſs were extream gallant, and in which they dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves with as much care as if they they had been to go to ſome Aſſembly, more eſpecially the Abbeſs who was unmindful of nothing ſhe knew would handſomly a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:150024:84"/>
no ſooner diſcovered that they were two Horſe-men coming with great haſte towards them, but they fled and got into the Garden without ſo much as thinking to ſhut to the door after them, and never ceaſed running as long as they were able; at length they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Monaſtery; both of them ſo ſpent, that they could ſcarcely breath; when they came home they in ſome meaſure regai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their courage, and being ſomething come to themſelves they began to laugh at the fear they had ſo improperly had for two men who deſigned only to proceed in their Journey; they took ſcourage by the power of arguing upon the ſmall ſubject they had to fear, and returned for the ſecond time to that gate, where they found two Horſes tyed to the foot of a Tree, and no body with them; the Abbeſs after ſhe had taken good notice of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, without diſcovering who it might be, found her ſelf much concerned to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why theſe two Horſes ſhould be there without a ſervant, and concluded after all (as it is eaſie to conclude things to ones advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage) that they might be her Farmers Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and that they muſt expect her man who was doubtleſs gone ſome-whither hard by, and indeed that was not altogether unlikely, and it was unlikely that any other would leave two Horſes thus; however this man came not again; the Abbeſs dyed with impatience, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:150024:85"/>
the time ſeemed ſo tedious that ſhe feared leſt the day-break might come, and that they might not have not night enough to execute their deſign cloſely: It was a puniſhment for her to ſtay, ſhe would have Sworn a thouſand times (if Abbeſſes ſwear) that they were her Farmers Horſes, that ſhe knew them, and that her man muſt either be hindred elſe-where with the other Horſe, or that he was fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep ſomewhere elſe, but they might alſo be the two Horſes upon which they had ſeen the two men riding; ſhe would not conſult upon that, becauſe we commonly love not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute our ſelves upon thoſe ſubjects that go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our deſire, we rather endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves; this Servant appeared not; the impatient and moſt truly love-ſick Abbeſs told her faithful Companion that they muſt make uſe of their time, and that the Occaſion was too fair to be neglected: That this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant was not ſo neceſſary but that they may paſs without him, and that he may follow them if he would: Her dear Companion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to all ſhe deſi ed, ſhe was willing for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing if they could have but any to direct them the way; ſo that without ſtaying any longer our two Adventurers put foot in the ſtirrup, mounted on Horſe-back without an Eſquire, and made ſo great diligence, that in leſs than an hour without any ill Adventure they arrived to the place where the Cavaleer

was: It was the Abbeſs that knocked at the door and who asked for a Gentleman that lodged there: They anſwered her that truly there had been one that Evening, but that he was gone from thence an hour ago with a Lacquey that had brought him a Letter; ſhe ſtill perſiſted in ſome queſtions to the Maſter of the Houſe concerning the way they went, and the Livery of the Foot-man, whether it might be long before this Gentleman would return? whether he had eaten? and at length even to ask him whether he ſeemed melancholy or merry? but the man knew not what to ſay, all that he knew for certain was, that he would not return that night, and that he had left no Order with them; no body could be more ſad than was the poor Abbeſs then; a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thoughts aſſaulted her at a time, of which there was not one but felt heavily; what heaps of grief and inquietneſs?

O the rage! the deſpair! to promiſe her ſelf ſo much ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in coming, and ſo many ſweet Fancies which ſhe had, and to return more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate than ever: Her Companion who was extreamly troubled to ſee her ſo ſtrangely ſad, would have given her ſome conſolation. Why do You afflict your ſelf thus Madam ſaid ſhe to her? it is true that the labour we have taken is a loſt one, but who knoweth whether it is not better for us that we have not proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

in our deſign of ſeeing the Cavaleer: You know him Madam, and as he is not the diſcree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in the world, perhaps this Viſit might have cauſed ſome rumors, we are at leaſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that we have gone a Journey without any ones knowledg: Without any ones knowledg replied ſadly this afflicted Lover; ſeeſt thou not my Child that weare betrayed, &amp; that my Siſter hath known ovr deſign, and that it was doubtleſs her that had ſent this Lacquey to the Cavaleer to let him know what we inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and to oblige him to ſhun me: how can what You ſay (Madam anſwered her this Maid) be true, if it be ſo long ſince the Cavaleer went from hence, you then ſcarce knew of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: what reaſon doſt thou think then ſhould uſe him to ſo ſudden a departure (ſaid the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs.) In fine, whatſoever her Companion told her after ſhe had muſed upon a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons, ſhe came alwaies to ſay again that her Siſter had done this thing, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had made him depart at that hour but her: This imaginatien troubled her furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; her Jealouſie encreaſed, and ſhe was perplexed with ſo many ſorts of grief, that ſhe ſaw none but ſubjects of ſorrow no where for her: This entertainment was ſomething different to that ſhe had had in going to ſee the Cavaleer; ſhe ſcarce ſpoke to her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and whatſoever the other ſaid to her to cauſe her to leave theſe ſad mufings, ſhe would

anſwer her in nothing but profound ſighes; they began however to think when they came home what they ſhould do with heir Horſes, which they found not a little troubleſome; but at laſt the beſt and ſureſt way they judged was to let them into the Garden, and to tye them ſome-where till it was day, that they might carefully ſend them home again to the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers. After that they had no more to do but to goe to the Monaſtery; however they were not got to the middle of the Garden before they found ſomething to ſtay them, they both thought they heard people talk.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:150024:87"/>
who were entertaining each other in at Love-commerce, ſhe would at leaſt know the truth of it.

Imagine then ſhe ſaw her diſpoſed to ſatisfie the Cavaleers deſire, and that the Fair-one was making preparation to go with him, for ſhe wanted cloaths more ſuitable to travel in than thoſe ſhe then wore, and ſo went to her Chamber to fetch them: The Abbeſs let her paſs by her, and came not out from where ſhe was till a great while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then ſhe fetched a great turn, and with her Maſque on her Face came into the Arbour where the Cavaleer was, who as ſoon as he ſaw her he embraced her, with much tenderneſs, and manifeſted many tokens of his Love to her; How charming are You ſaid he to her taking her for his Miſtreſs, in that You have not made no long ſtay, for truly I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to ſee Your Return: But what Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence did ſhe uſe to conceal her diſpleaſure, it being not yet time for her to make her ſelf known, nor diſcover her ſelf: You need not wonder at the miſtake of the Cavaleer; ſhe ſeemed not ſo ſtrange in the night-time, for beſides the little difference there is in the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

nothing but to ſecure himſelf in the place of ſafety in which he had already deſigned to be; the Abbeſs anſwered him not a word to all he ſaid to her, upon which he made even no reflection, having his mind buſied about his enterprize; and in this ſort they went to the gate, where he was not a little ſurprized to find it ſhut; but ſhe preſently eaſed him of that trouble, and took the Key ſhe had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her and opened it; by what meanes, or rather by what good Fortune ſaid the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leer then to her, (who knew that none but the Abbeſs had the Key to that door: Have you had this Key?) ſhe anſwered him no more than before, at which he took as little notice as before, and went forth to get pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently on Horſe-back, but the Horſes were gone from thence, and his man who had been ſeeking them, told him in a ſad note, that he knew not where they were, and that he had been two hours about them without hearing of them, that he was come to acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Abbeſs did moſt agreeably requite all the cruel diſpleaſures which her Siſter had given her; ſhe let her run to come again to her Companion, who waited for her with extream impatience, being furiouſly troubled to be thus alone in the middle of a Garden expoſed to all the noiſes ſhe heard, which aſſaulted her with fear; ſhe related to her all ſhe had done ſince ſhe had left her, and how ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Cavaleer, and how her Siſter was frighted, which made them both to laugh with much Joy; they ſtayed a little longer to ſee if ſhe would return, but in vain, the fright of this Lady was ſuch that ſhe was like to dye, and ſhe kept her bed a very long time; at length they retired, and uſed good meanes that no body might go forth of the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in having double locked the door.

               <p>As ſoon as I had read this Note, I mounted on Horſe-back, and in a very little time came to the Garden wall, where I knew of a place that was not difficult to climb up, having potwithſtanding found the door open, I made uſe without going further of ſo favourable an occaſion; it is true it ſurprized me, and I did truly believe that <hi>Egidia</hi> had found out a way to open it: I bid her Lacquey tye the two Horſes to the foot of ſome Tree, and to make haſt without any noiſe to advertize my man to prepare himſelf at the time given to depart with me: After I had given this Order, I went, or to ſpeak better, I flew directly to this Arbor, where <hi>Egidia</hi> waited for me; it was at that inſtant when the Abbeſs returned to the Garden-gate that ſhe found my Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that ſhe took them for thoſe her man ſhould have brought, and that ſhe uſed them to render me that extraordinary Viſit. But not to continue longer in the relation of a ſmall Hiſtory which doth already begin to ſeem long: I will only tell You that <hi>Egidia</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me in this Arbour with a joy which made me forget all the evil uſage I had received from

her, that we both of us paſſed ſome moments in very much tenderneſs, and that the brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt day that could be, never ſeemed ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to me as did this charming night; I ſpoke to her of the Letter which I had ſent her, ſhe was ſurprized, and aſſured me that ſhe had not received it; we preſently thought that it was fallen into the hands of the Abbeſs, and that my Servant muſt have been miſtaken, or have betrayed me. In fine, after many juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications on both ſides, after I ſay many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of new Friendſhips, of ſighs and langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhings where Lovers abound in a ſweet recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, I propoſed to her to carry her away, as you have heard from Madam <hi>d'Eyrac;</hi> I urged her ſo much and in ſo many wayes, that at length ſhe conſented, and prepared her ſelf to follow me: I confeſs I was a little ſurprized to ſee her ſo ſoon returned; but who had then thought on the Abbeſs? I ſaw her Masked, ſhe was in a riding Garb, ſhe ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled not to go with me; and in a word, if my Horſes had been ready, there is no doubt but if ſhe was willing, I ſhould have carried her away for her Siſter; I will not ſtay to tell You the wonder that ſeized me when I ſaw her re-enter the Garden, and ſhut the door up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, I thought at firſt that ſhe had a mind to jeſt; but as her railery laſted ſomething too long for people that had no time to looſe, and that ſhe came not although I called never ſo

loud, I thought to my ſelf that this was no jeſting: I imagined that ſhe feigned to follow me only to put this trick upon me, and that I had been the moſt abuſed of all men; then was it that ſhame, ſpite, and diſdain excited terrible tempeſts in my Soul, which joyned to the diſpleaſure of not knowing what were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of my Horſes, nor what might be become of my ſelf, put me into ſuch deſpair, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, reproaches, and injuries came forth of my mouth in multitudes againſt <hi>Egidia;</hi> this Offence ſeemed to me the greateſt that any Gentleman could receive. I conſidered it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way, and there was no circumſtance but made it plain to me. I retired in this manner into the Village, for there was no other way for me, and I lodged at my Ancient Hoſt's, where I paſſed away a much more cruel night than I did the firſt time I came there. I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in my mind all the ſervices I had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to this Ingrateful One, all the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſhe had made to me; and wondring that I had not diſcovered the lightneſs of her Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, I accuſed my ſelf both of Imprudence and Blindneſs; and I joyned to the firſt of my Deſpairs an Indignation againſt all that I had done that concluded my ruine.

               <p>This place proceeded the Cavaleer is but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle proper to divertize the Company, for here is nothing but Tears; I gave her a Viſit, and I avow to you that I found my ſelf ſo inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly moved to ſee her in the condition ſhe was in, that I could not be Maſter of my heart, I could not refrain giving of it eaſe by a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of tears which immediatly trickled from my eyes; all that were preſent could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear weeping with me, inſomuch that even the Abbeſs was concerned to ſee in what manner I was afflicted; this poor Lady who endured no leſs than me, uſed ſome endeavour to tell me ſome things of concernment in the world, and ſpoke to me as if ſhe had been to depart that day, and truly moſt of them believed that ſhe would ſcarce live much longer; but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven would preſerve her to be an example of a moſt rare conſtancy, and of a moſt ſweet and civil Friendſhip in which we have lived ever ſince: Perhaps you know not ſaid Madam <hi>de Eyrac</hi> to him, that no body hath contributed ſo much to the recovery of her health than me, and you ſhall ſee how; this Maid, or if you will the companion of the Abbeſs, who as I have told you more than once repoſed much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in me, failed not to come and give me
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:150024:96"/>
an account of this Adventure, and how your Miſtreſs had been frighted, ſo that it was not difficult for me to know the cauſe of her Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and what might be the meanes to cure her mind: Every body obſerved an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary trouble in her Eyes, and ſuch a diſorder in her words, that ſhe ſeemed to be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual dream: I took pitty on her, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was to Sacrifice my Friend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Secret which ſhe had confided in me, I believed that in the extremity wherein this poor Lady was, there was nothing which I might not hazard to endeavour her recovery. I took the opportunity juſt when there was no Body with her but a Young Maiden whom I did not miſtruſt, and I asked her boldly whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her diſtemper proceeded not from ſome trouble of mine? and whether ſhe thought me not enough her Friend? to declare it to me. She looked ſtedfaſtly upon me and bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thinking that I would ſpeak of the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leer: But having afterwards ſaid that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps knew the cauſe of her Illneſs better than ſhe did her ſelf, and that I could deliver her from the fear which ſhe had in the Garden, ſhe lifted her ſelf ſuddenly up in the Bed, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me by the hand, Oh Heaven! Madam ſaid ſhe, what you tell me ſurprizeth me I Could it be poſſible that in my muſings I ſhould ſpeak of any thing like that? no, no! anſwered I to her in interrupting her, I came
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:150024:97"/>
to the knowledg of it ſome other way than by you, and I believe that no Body here ever heard you ſpeak of any ſuch thing; the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that frighted You told it to me, and I thought I ought not to leave you any longer in this trouble. I imagine that you will do ſo well that I may have no cauſe to complain of your diſcretion, and that you will make good uſe of the confidence I have in You: She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it me, and I told her all that had paſſed in the Garden after the manner I had heard it related, and which did ſo greatly amaze her, that ſhe could ſcarce have believed me had I not told her all that hapned to her ſelf, and even to the entertainment which ſhe had had with the Cavaleer; ſhe bluſhed, and I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that ſhe was aſhamed that I knew this part of the ſtory. But in fine, ſince this time by little and little her mind was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled; ſhe recovered her ſtrength, and in a ſmall time he Health entirely; I know not how ſhe hath uſed it ſince with you; but I know that ſhe had taken very ſtrong reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that not knowing how to forbear to love You, ſhe would do it in a manner that ſhe might not render an account to Heaven. I will aſſure you Madam anſwered the Cavaleer to her that ſhe hath alſo done it, and that it is no more than a Brotherly Friendſhip, to which in truth I had much difficulty to reduce my ſelf, but ſhe would have it; and at length I
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:150024:97"/>
brought my ſelf to it. I pray tell us a little ſaid the Marchioneſs <hi>de Sindal</hi> how you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards did with the Abbeſs, and in what manner you put her off. I believe proceeded the Cavaleer that the Abbeſs rebuked me fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſince the laſt Evening, and that what ſhe heard while I was in the Arbour with her Siſter, finiſhed he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ever avoided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone with her, during the ſmall time I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Abbey, and when I departed I took my leave of her before five or ſix Ladies her Friends who were in her Chamber with her Here the Cavaleer ended his Story, and the Dutcheſs Invited the Company to take a ſmall turn in the Garden before they retired, they were all the reſt of the time entertaining each other about this Adventure, and divers were their Opinions; but having done tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (according to their uſual cuſtome) when each dayes Converſation was ended) they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves to Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armand</hi> for a Song, and ſhe gave them this.</p>

               <p>THe Fifth day although it was the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, was not the leſs recreative; on the contrary the Sun is never more pleaſant in the Summer, than when he ſhoweth himſelf with leſs pomp than ordinary, and under the thick Vale of ſome Clouds which he cannot pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate with his beams; the ſeaſon was very proper to take a walk in. The Dutcheſs uſed it to give ſome Viſits to ſome of her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and ſhe was accompanied by this illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious and moſt gallant company, and they returned not till about the Evening to take a magnificent Treat which the Duke had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them in the ſame Arbour where the Circle was kept: things were no ſooner taken away, but they had ſome agreeable diſcourſe of Railery as a prelude to ſomething better, and which ſerved only to diſpoſe their minds to furniſh a moſt agreeable matter of Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, the Dutcheſs who would give the Honour to the Counteſs <hi>d'Ermond</hi> entreated her to propoſe ſome Queſtion; ſhe excuſed it with a very good Grace, and immediatly asked her that they might continue to do as they had begun, and not to have theſe particular regards, that when it ſhould come to her turn, ſhe would ſpeak as the reſt: The Dutcheſs
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:150024:99"/>
urged her no farther, and left this care to Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armond</hi> who was ever in the charge of Lieutenant; this Lady ſaid that it was not neceſſary to ſeek new ſubjects of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, ſince there were already two upon the board, the gallanteſt of the world, and wherein ſhe for her particular was too much intereſſed to let it paſs by. I have not forgot continued ſhe how two dayes ſince it was propoſed to us to learn how to diſcover the falſe and true Lovers, and how a Lady might receive a declaration of Love; and I remember ſtill very well added ſhe, that the Count took upon him to tell us theſe two things which are important in the world, and wherein he will not fail to be ſuccesful after he hath had ſome time of conſideration. The Dutcheſs ſaid, that in effect theſe were the two ſubjects of Converſation, which they did not continue, and ſhe prayed the Company to give it attention: I avow to You anſwered the Count, that although I had prepared my ſelf, as hath ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>deArmond</hi> for a matter like this with which I ſhould enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain You; I find it ſo difficult, that I ſhall ſtill have trouble enough to come off with the ſucceſs I ſhould do: but be it in what manner it will, I will notwithſtanding perform what You deſire of me, and prefer the honour of obeying You before the ſhame of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuccesful in my Enterprize. The firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:150024:100"/>
I pretend to give to a Lady, like that, whoſe Picture I drew three dayes ago, is not lightly to believe that ſhe is loved, and to be the laſt to ſay it; there are I know not how many Women in the World who do not only believe all the proteſtations the men make them, but it rejoyceth them to hear what they will ſay to them when they ſigh and complain by them; they endure with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Vanity all the praiſes they give them, or if they defend themſelves, it is ſo weakly, and in a certain manner, that they may ſee it is not what they hate, and that maugre all their Grimaces, that the ſecret to pleaſe them is to flatter them. My Opinion is that a Lady ſhould alwaies let them ſee that theſe ſorts of Diſcourſes moleſt them, that ſhe loveth not that way to let them gain her eſteem, that ſhe knowerh her ſelf, and whether ſhe be Fair or not, that ſhe knoweth it without giving any one the trouble to tell it her; ſhe ought to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that a man hath not much eſteem for her, who dares to ſpeak to her publickly of Love: that true Love rendreth people reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and that they muſt at leaſt have ſighed long before they come to a declaration: All theſe maxims are Touch-ſtones for the falſe ſighers, and the leaſt reſiſtance ſendeth them going, and who are not Lovers but when a Lady is ſo innocent to let her ſelf be perſwaded to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes, tranſports to Tears and to ſighes of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:150024:100"/>
Commrnd; they Swear that they alone hav more love than all the met together, and they know not what this paſſion is, all their care tendeth only to make them believe what they ſay; but they are not alwaies believed; and I dare aver that were all Women reaſonable, there would be no falſe Lovers, the ſelf-weakneſs of this Sex draweth upon them all theſe Treacheries; the men would ſeek to deceive, the leſs did they not find ſo much Facility in it. Now as in former Times, there will ever be Traytors, and Women abuſed. But what ſaid Madamoiſelle <hi>de Armand</hi> to him, interrupting him, muſt a Woman then do when a man is ſo very bold as to make a declaration of his Love to her? muſt ſhe be ſevere, and treat him illy, and ſend him away that he may not ſee her more? On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary anſwered her the Count, I would only have her to give him an anſwer, whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet coldneſs might give him to underſtand that ſhe taketh no pleaſure in thoſe ſorts of Liberties, and if he be a Gentleman that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how to carry himſelf with her, and who mentioneth not his paſſion to her, but in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt termes and under a hidden ſenſe, which is the way that witty perfons uſe, I believe that it may be very eaſie for this Fair-one to rid her out of trouble, and that ſhe may give to his words what ſignification ſhe pleaſeth, as if ſhe underſtood nothing, and turn the diſcourſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:150024:101"/>
upon another matter, that if it ſo hapneth that ſhe cannot but give what he ſaith the true meaning, ſhe might convert it all into Railery, and attribute it to a certain cuſtome which witty perſons have when they are in company with Ladies, that they make it a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to praiſe them, and to tell them that they love them; there is more ſafety that way, when a Lady hath the readineſs to uſe it ingeniouſly. You ſpeak ſaid the Cavaleer as if all men were deceivers; and pray tell me to what torments ſhould you not condemn a brave Gentleman that were truly in Love with a Lady; if they all followed your Maxims; ſhould you be contented continued he to be in his place, and to be reduced to thoſe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which this paſſion is accuſtomed to make unfortunate Lovers ſuffer, when they find themſelves with thoſe that are inſenſible or given to Railery, which implyeth procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he, that if the Women would believe you, they ſhall eſteem the ſervices and tears of their Lovers, as if they were meer trifles, and a ſubjection more aſſiduous, more careful, and more earneſt than that of ſlaves ſhall be for perſons who ſhall diſdein and laugh at us; you give in truth ſuch counſels that are but little humane; you ſhould beware how you inſtruct this Sex in new injuſtices, for this is not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt, and we commonly ſee them but too full of Cruelty. You are too ſoon moved
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:150024:101"/>
anſwered the Count to him ſmiling; I have not yet ſpoken preciſely of thoſe that truly Love, but only in general of thoſe who ſpeak of Loving, and ſay they love. Here are many that ſay it too well to do it; 'tis commonly thoſe who love moſt that ſpeak it leſs; the eyes and ſilence ſpeak in love, and one ever ſaith enough to thoſe that rejoyce to underſtand us; if I muſt ſpeak the truth, I believe that it is very difficult to give certain rules upon what You now demand of me, for as many as there be of men, as many wayes are there to love, the Proverb confirmeth it enough, that ſaith, Let every one love ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Guiſe: How ſhall I tell you then the cautions, a Lady ought to have upon this without firſt examining the different wayes of making Love; that which is moſt true, and ought to paſs as a general Maxime, is that a Lady ought not to make it known that ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth before ſhe hath had great experiences of her Lover, and to wait till he diſcovereth it, becauſe it is ever dangerous for a Lady to have diſcovered her fire, whereas the men make it their glory to have declared their paſſion. I perceive ſaid the Baron that You will ſpeak for the Married Women; for the Maidens I believe not that the moſt ſevere carriage can keep them from diſcloſing a thing ſo natural as is that to love, and to ſay that one loveth eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to thoſe of whoſe fidelity and love
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:150024:102"/>
they are perſwaded; if it were ſo the Love might return and continue in the place from whence it ſprung; there is no man that would engage himſelf to Love in that manner unleſs it were to hate himſelf, I know not what would become of us: I ſpeak anſwered him the Count of all Women, and much more for the Maids than the Married Women, to whoſe Vertue theſe ſorts of Engagements cannot but do much prejudice. What You aver there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>d'Arignan</hi> to him is very auſtere, not to permit the Married Women to love as well as the others. I will aſſure You there are but few would Marry were it ſo; we muſt leave theſe things to a Preacher, or to thoſe that deny love to the world that they may have the better part: There are continued he ſo many unfortunate Women who without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are ſo illy uſed by their Husbands; ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my others whom their Parents have Married to old jealous heads to Brutes to peeviſh Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs that make them live in ſo ſtrange a manner; if a Divorce was permitted for theſe Women, and that they could deliver themſelves from their Tyrants, I would not pardon their weakneſs in loving elſe-where as long as they remained with them: But when by the effects of ſome bad ſtar, or when their deſtiny will have it ſo, that in the bed where they ſhould meet the pleaſures of Love and Peace, they have theſe cruel Hang-men to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:150024:102"/>
them, and with whom they muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force live (if we may call the time they paſs with them life:) Would You have theſe poor Ladies deprive themſelves of the only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they have to oblige a Gallant Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which an Owl of an Husband hath not only in diſdain but horror. I agree added <hi>de Arignan,</hi> that a Woman who hath a Husband that underſtandeth Reaſon, and who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how to live, ſhould rather dye than do him any Injury. But for the unfortunate Ones, I forgive them all, and they would do themſelves wrong if they knew of a ſure way to be revenged of their Domeſtick Enemies, and ſhould not do it. The Ladies all laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the opinion of <hi>d'Arignan,</hi> and the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs told him that he ſpoke as one Intereſſed, and that if he had been a Woman, and a VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Honour, he would have had other O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions; ſhe added further, that it was a naughty revenge to ruine her ſelf to do her Enemy a diſpleaſure, and that a Civil Lady had her actions to anſwer to others more than her Husband; however it is ſaid the Count, to come to the Married perſons, I ſay that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing that doth not alwaies depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us not to love, I would that when this misfortune hapneth to any of them, and that the Injuſtice of her Husband, or the deſire ſhe hath for another, bringeth her to ſome incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; I would I ſay have her make no other
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:150024:103"/>
agreement with him than for a tender friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and eſteem, and never to give him ſuch certain tokens of what ſhe ſuffereth for him, whereby the Cavaleer might make it his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: There is no man ſaid the Cavaleer but would Appeal from this ſentence before the VVomen themſelves: But after You have taught ſuch a ſtrange humor, and ſuch ſevere maxims to thoſe that are Married, will You at leaſt not grant ſomething more mild to thoſe that are to Marry; and will You not let them have ſomething more of Indulgence for thoſe whom we may call true Lovers. If a Young Lady anſwered the Count muſt love a man, it muſt be thoſe with whom ſhe hopeth to be Married, and then I ſhould not condemn her although ſhe ſhowed him ſome tokens of eſteem. Nevertheleſs I would have it be with ſo much reſervedneſs, that her Vertue might find nothing wherewith to reproach her heart: I will aſſure You a Lady cannot be too cautious upon this Article, and that the men have now ſo much preſumption of themſelves, and are ſo much accuſtomed to promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all from their own merit, that the leaſt favour flattereth them, and maketh them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from their duty.

Courage Sir ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhe in ſmiling, the Btave Ones like You are not amazed at ſtripes; You uſed me too illy (ſaid ſhe Abbot) the firſt time for me to dare to adventure any more: But however, were it neceſſary for me to expoſe my Life for the Truths ſake I would maintain it well that there hath been nothing ſaid on Your behalf in all there hath hitherto been ſpoken. Stay replied the ſame Lady to him til Monſieur <hi>d'Armenton</hi> be in a humor to anſwer You, for I believe he is preparing notwithſtanding he hath been ſo long ſilent: I Madam anſwered her <hi>d'Armenton,</hi> I ſwear I have not ſuch a thought, becauſe that all that the Count hath ſpoken I find ſo juſt and reaſonable, that they muſt be Void of Senſe who are not for him, and who dare to contradict him. For my part replyed the Count, I expoſe here neither par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and I only ſpeak what belongeth to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and a good cuſtom againſt abuſe and falſe appearances: But to return where I was, there are I know not how many VVomen who deſire nothing more than to be eſteemed hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, to have at their Train a multitude of Lovers of which they make a Trophy, and who ſerve as a Triumph to their Beauty; they employ all meanes for theſe Conqueſts, and make no difficulty to make advancements to

I ſay that a Ladies merit is much greater, when the Conqueſts ſhe maketh are meerly due to her own Vertue, and when the good Behaviour and Grace ſhe hath in all her actions, draweth hearts to her. Love is much more ſolid when it is grounded upon eſteem, than when it is upheld by Beauty alone: Eſteem may ever continue, and Beauty fadeth, and a Lover who is tyed to particular Features is ſubject to very many accidents, and cannot Love but in Fear, whereas he that ſuffereth himſelf to be enclined to Vertue, loveth without moleſiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ceaſeth not to love till death; a man who ſhall love a Lady as I ſay will be ſatisfied

I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow ſaid the Cavaleer, that what the Count ſaid is not ſo extraordinary, but ſome of it is practiſed by many VVomen: But it is alſo true, that he is ſomething ſcrupulous in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain matters, and that there is even injuſtice in it, not to permit a Miſtreſs to give ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Hope to a poor Lover that ſhall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh for her, that one day at leaſt he may be Loved. I have ſeen VVomen added he, whom Beauty rendred them perhaps ſomething too proud, who at the only words of Love would ſeem to be extreamly angry, but in the end, theſe Obſtinate Beauties have if not ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, at leaſt grown very mild, and the ſervices, importunities, ſighs, and tears have worked ſo upon them, that they have alſo taken delight to love ſuch a one were the moſt rigorous perſon in the world, that could reſiſt at the ſight of a languiſhing Lover whom ſhe ſees upon his knees to her: A heart though Obſtinate, is not inſenſible, and it is a difficult thing to eſcape
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:150024:105"/>
loving when one is perſwaded of a perſons merit, there is nothing ſometimes that in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth truer Love than Obſtinacy when Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and thoſe Hearts which are the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culteſt to win, are thoſe which are moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: You imagine ſaid the Marchioneſs to him every one to be like your Religious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Not ſo anſwered her the Cavaleer: but you will confeſs that if all VVomen were as the Count would make them, they would not be very amiable, and very few wiſe men would love them. Perhaps ſaid the Count to him, that all people would not be of your Opinion as You are not of mine; but however if You took notice, I ſaid not that a Miſtreſs ſhould bring a poor Lover to deſpair, I am not for ſuch Barbarous Counſels, I avoid Extremities in all things, and my Opinion in this was, that a Lady ought to grant no other than a tender Friendſhip and Eſteem, and it is with this a Gentleman may reſt ſatisfied from ſuch a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I ſpoke of. It is true continued he, that in Love the Pallates are as different as there are difference in Beauties, and that one cannot Regulate all Lovers to one and the ſame point; there are of them who ſeeing a Lady of a humor ſomething ſerious, and who is accuſtomed not to do any thing but what ſeemeth very civil, will be taken with a certain reſpect for her, that they ſcarcely dare bring their deſires to love; they will rather love ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:150024:105"/>
whoſe languiſhings, words, and glances may give them leave to hope. I alſo know others who care little for the Artifices, and all the outward appearances of certain Beauties who ignorize nothing of Gallantry, they will ſooner engage themſelves to a Fair-one whoſe humor ſeemeth full of ſincerity, and who they find without art and faſhion, I mean without being too witty; they will love that ſimplicity which ſhall cauſe her to utter her thoughts in matters as they are, there are yet lovers of a character much different from theſe who would paſs for ingenious people, and who vainly believe that in Love as in all things elſe, the glory of a Conqueſt conſiſteth in the difficulty and reſiſtance; they are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that there is no Victory more ſweet than to overcome that which others have found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible; they will apply themſelves to Beauty, whoſe looks, words, and proud Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, menace nothing but Rigours; as if there were no advantage more glorious than to reduce a proud heart to love. Theſe ſame men will ſometimes love certain Women that uſe a thouſand Artifices, and who are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten-times more difficult to vanquiſh, than thoſe who are auſtere by profeſſion; they try yet others whoſe diſdainful humour with few words, and ſome ſmiles, ſeemeth to deſpiſe the whole Univerſe, and with whom it is a crime to dare only to behold them. I have ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:150024:106"/>
kind of Lovers who were for the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-gallants, and of great Converſation, for thoſe who would ſhow them fair play, and whom nothing could ſhake; in a word, who love facility, and the VVomen that are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But when an underſtanding Lady ſhall miſs of all theſe ſorts of Lovers, I'll not think her unfortunate. I know very well that thoſe who are already endued with Vertue, and love Diſcretion, deſire not ſuch rediculous ones; there are for them enough that ſeek merit as well as beauty, who ſerve the Graces of the mind as well as thoſe of the body, and who can love in a much more ſolid manner than the others; theſe are Lovers who ever give teſtimonies of a paſſion as reſpectful as Violent, and think their ſervice well requited with a ſmall affection, which a Miſtreſs of the humor I have deſcribed ſhall teſtifie; they would not require a publick declaration from her, nor any favour which might touch the rules of Civility. Confeſs ſaid <hi>d'Arignan</hi> that there is much Tyranny in this Civility: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:150024:106"/>
the cauſe of your ſighing and weeping; what do You think ſaid ſhe, that when a Lady hath ſeen in the Cavaleers eyes that he hath a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for her, that ſhe is Obliged to declare to him what ſhe hath for him, is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that ſhe ſeparateth him from others? that ſhe heareth his ſighs, and explaineth them as ſhe ought? that ſhe loveth to ſee her ſelf loved? that ſhe alſo pittieth and bewaileth him, and in fine, that ſhe perhaps deſireth what he deſireth? without coming to what is too difficult to do, and too dangerous for a Lady to tell her ſufferings in that caſe. It is true ſaid the Abbot in ſmiling, that it would be a very ſenſible recompence, and that the pleaſure would be gteat to be made happy in that manner. By your leave Madam, I pray tell me what ſweetneſs one can ſuck from a thing that one is ignorant of; and how a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall know if he poſſeſſeth the happineſs he hath ſo much hoped for, and for which he hath done ſo much ſervice; if his Miſtreſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaith any thing to him, and if he knoweth not in what manner he is ſeated in her mind, for my part I ſhould almoſt as ſoon love to be hated; and I conclude that there is a neceſſity in Love to declare their minds on both ſides: Nevertheleſs with this Order, that the men are to begin, but the VVomen muſt ſecond them. If any Body be ſo nice as to think it a thing ſo very troubleſome as to ſay [I love You] as the Counteſs <hi>d'Ermond</hi> would make

I believe anſwered her <hi>d'Armenton,</hi> that there would aſſuredly be much ſweetneſs in Love if the Ladies were a little indulgent, and if they would paſs over ſome ce tain conſiderations, and ſubmit to our firſt ſighs, ſince in effect it is enough to be loved as one loveth, to abſtain from being unhappy in Love, Modeſty, certain Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and I know not what other ſcruples of

The Ladies have not a Heart different from Ours, they are not Inſenſible, and though our Sex cannot make ſhow of ſo much paſſion and tenderneſs as this, they nevertheleſs do not forbear to have as we have, or to be capable as we are. Why all theſe Rigours then? why this affected ſeverity? and why not to manifeſt their deſires ſometimes as much as we? would it not be better that there were none but happy Lovers and ſenſible Miſtreſſes, that tenderneſs governed every where; that nothing was done but in Love, and that it were the chief of all things, as by the Law of Nature it ought: Can one doubt that a Gentlewoman would not be glad to ſee her ſelf loved by an accompliſhed Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and more if ſhe loved him, and gave way to her Inclination to act; and would ſhe not much more if ſhe rendred him happy, and could ſay that ſhe wiſhed it? wherefore <hi>de
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:150024:108"/>
Armenton</hi> you muſt confeſs that you are not in the right, and that VVomen being ſenſible of love, joy, and grief, as of all other paſſions, do themſelves a moſt horrible Injuſtice to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themſelves to cauſe our trouble, and that they ſhould follow other Laws than thoſe the Count hath preſcribed them. VVhatſoever you can ſay replied the Dutcheſs, we are Obliged to the Count for having taught the VVomen an honeſt method of loving, and to render the thing alike; ſome Lady in the Company ſhould ſhow the ſame to the men. I believe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam anſwered her the Baron, it is the Women only muſt be taught the art to Love, becauſe there are but few that know it; they eſteem it a point of Honour to be marble-hearted, and the Count authorizeth them in theſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; but for the men, they know but too well how to love, and the beauty of VVomen is a great Maſter to teach them, one thing they ſhould ſhow us is the manner to make them love us. VVell let us ſee then ſaid Madam <hi>de Armand</hi> to him what you can ſay upon it, You who have been ſo ſuccesful in two or three places wherein You have continued: You would perhaps Madam anſwered her the Baron make me believe that I have not been unhappy in Love, to engage me to tell You what I deſire to know, and that the Evils I have ſuffered make me diſcern that I am alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Ignorant of it. I am none of thoſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:150024:109"/>
who convert all into mildneſs, far from that, I am of thoſe ſort of people to whom a little evill ſpoileth all the Fortune in the world; Judge then if it be eaſie to be perſwaded to what You ſay; I that in all my Life have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed ſo little felicity and ſo many Evils to endure; ſo it is thoſe Gentlemen do ſaid the Counteſs <hi>d'Ancire</hi> that would go for diſcreet, and give a good Opinion of their Carriage. But happy or unhappy, You ſhall however tell us which is the ſhorteſt way a Gentleman can take to cauſe himſelf to be loved by a Lady: Reaſon would replyed the Baron, that in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Ladies we ſhould obtain their good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: But we muſt firſt know of themſelves after what manner they deſire to be ſerved, to the end we may Oblige them accordingly, for ſome will after one manner, and others after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and there are ſome that deſire things ſo particular, that a man would be very much troubled to Divine, and that they ſometimes know not themſelves. It is for this Reaſon added he, in regarding the Marchioneſs of <hi>Sindal,</hi> that You muſt do it, who knoweth all things that can pleaſe the perſons of Your Sex. It is You I ſay that muſt take upon You the trouble to tell us the manner of ſerving Ladies to Ones advantage. It would be a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great profit for men, and thoſe of the Company would be particularly Obliged to You for it. You may Your ſelf replied the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:150024:109"/>
Marchioneſs ſtill take this care, for You know well enough the cautions that muſt be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Nevertheleſs ſince You deſire it, I will tell You that generally with all the world he that deſires to be loved muſt love; and that this quality ſufficeth a gallant Gentleman to keep himſelf from being hated by his Miſtreſs. Now if without making You bluſh continued ſhe in ſmiling, I may ſay in Your preſence that You have paſſed for one aimable enough; and I will add further, that You would be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more if You did not love in ſo many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for that cannot be called Love. Rivers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſo many places do at length become ſmall Brooks: a heart divided among ſo many perſons, cannot have much Love for one only Object: In the mean time You ſend out your complaints, and give Your ſelf over to weeping, and to reproaches againſt moſt of thoſe VVomen that You have ſerved, and that have known you better than the others, as if they were Obliged to love You better than You can do; there are ſome that You have too well perſwaded not quite to forſake You, I pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty them, eſpecially one of my acquaintance, and who to act her part better, would have You ſeemingly Court a Lady her Neighbour; but I know not who would be the moſt abuſed: If it ſhould happen that You became really in Love with this Neighbour, for without ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king falſe, ſhe is too Fair to ſerve for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:150024:110"/>
what You ſay there Madam (replied the Baron) is the unjuſteſt thing in the world, and it would be no great trouble to me to let you ſee the contrary: If I might be believed when I ſpeak the truth, it is a terrible thing for a man when the VVomen are once ſet to his diſadvantage: I do all I can to pleaſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of whom the Marchioneſs ſpeaketh, I ſpare neither care nor paines, I render her more Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits than ever I did to any in this world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I love her more than one can love, and yet you will have it only a pretence, I believe unleſs I dyed for her I ſhould not be believed: I may well complain—your Complaints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves interrupted the Marchioneſs, make it appear that there is Artifice in your procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or at leaſt that You love her but little, ſince You deſire of her what ſhe would not have You, againſt the firſt law of Love which Ordaineth that we muſt not deſire but what the perſon deſireth whom we love. Alas ſaid the Baron, I deſire but too well what ſhe deſireth, and if I complain, it is of her Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and that ſhe will not grant me that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of her; after which I am well grounded to believe abcording to the Law you ſay, that ſhe loveth me not: It belongeth to him replied the Marchiones that beginneth to love firſt, to be al, ſo the firſt to deſire to pleaſe and accomodate himſelf wholly to the humor of the perſon, he condereth he muſt govern himſelf to pleaſe her

will, and make his deſires to be the ſlaves of hers, his Soul it ſelf ought to Obey her in all things, and never to be transformed into any thing but her if it were poſſible, and make it his laſt Felicity: True Lovers ought to do thus. My felicity replied the Baron, would doubtleſs be to have one will to be Miſtreſs of her heart and mine: but how ſhall this accord be made if ſhe never doth any thing for me, while I do all things for her; if ſhe doth not ſomething ſlacken this great ſeverity to give me at leaſt ſome hope. The Baron was there when a Page came to tell the Dutcheſs that there was a great company of Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity newly arrived; for which reaſon the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was broke up, and this Queſtion went no farther, that they might follow the Dutcheſs who went before to meet thoſe that came to Viſit her.</p>

               <p>THe Sixth day the Dutcheſs gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany an Entertainment, which I cannot relate here without making a long digreſſion of ſomething very Noble. But I believe it is better not to trouble the Readers patience, (for nothing troubleth it more than digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that I ſay only in paſſing that they had a Ball and a Play, and towards the Evening marvellous artificial Fire-works; after which they returned to form the Circle, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe new Queſtions.</p>
               <p>Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armand</hi> addreſſed her ſelf firſt to <hi>d'Arignan</hi> to make the breach for a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble converſation, and he thus began.</p>
               <p>I remember ſaid he, that the Count hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the Ladies how to receive a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Love, but no body hath yet ſaid in what manner it muſt be done, for in ſine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he, what muſt we hope from the fidelities, cares, and ſervices which we do to theſe Fair-ones if they know not upon what deſign we do them: There are many things anſwered Ma 'amoiſelle <hi>d'Armand</hi> that ſpeak but too much what a man feels when he is in Love, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſilence; all things ſpeak in Love; that is certain replied <hi>d'Arignan:</hi> But how many Miſtreſſes are there that ſeem blind to all the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:150024:113"/>
reſpects which the Lovers have for them, and ſhow them, to all that ſighes may make them underſtand; ſo that all theſe advancements being without effect, or at leaſt without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, a miſerable Lover is at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to complain, and from Complaint to paſs to a Dec aration. I would then deſire ſome body to learn me the ſecret (if there be any one) to explain ones ſelf to a Miſtreſs, without going in danger to diſpleaſe her. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks proceeded he, that it would very well agree with Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armand</hi> to do it: If ſhe would have the goodneſs to tell us any thing, as I am not in a humor anſwered this Lady to receive a Declaration of this nature in what manner ſoever, I cannot tell You any, but would diſpleaſe me. I will truly tell you that to be loved or not to be loved, is not ſo indifferent to me, but I could deſire it; it is a deſire too natural to our Sex; but I would if it were poſſible for me very much to hinder a man from entertaining me of his Love, if through hazard he had any for me, ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to me; and for the reſt, I would ever counſel a friend not to ſpeak till the laſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and to have done all things before he cometh to theſe words (I love You) and it muſt alſo be done with ſo much diſcretion and ſo properly, that he muſt conſider of it often before he ſaith it. If it be ſo troubleſome a thing ſaid the Abbot ſmiling to ſay tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

loveth, it muſt be in writing on the contrary replied Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armand</hi> to him; if he be a man that is diſcreet, and underſtandeth Heroical Gallantry, he will not uſe this means, You ſay there is leſs trouble in it, but there is alſo more danger in it; and one is rarely ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful becauſe the liberty is greater, and that a Lady much ſooner excuſeth a word eſcaped from ones mouth, than what is writ to her. I know not replied the Baron, but if I be not deceived, whatever grimaces theſe Ladies make to us, when we declare to them the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we have for them, ſince according to the confeſſion of Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armond</hi> her ſelf they are glad to be loved, &amp; I believe not in the end that they will be diſpleaſed with one for telling it to them: In truth You are deceived replyed the Marchioneſs to him, and the moſt part of Lovers do but ill to truſt to that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: What muſt they do then replied the Duke on a ſudden if it be me You ask ſaid the ſame Lady to him, I will tell You my mind. A Lover who hath a deſire to proceed to a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ought to do it with a moſt reſpectful Carriage, and in the ſame moment ſo diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that his words may inſenſibly diſpoſe the mind of his Miſtreſs favourably to receive what he will ſay to her, and that they may have a double meaning by which meanes he may deliver himſelf from trouble, if he ſeeth her in a humor to give him attention, for elſe it
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:150024:114"/>
were to ruine him; a Lady that had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to live familiarly with him, and to treat him like a friend of eſteem and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would be no more ſo, but very reſerved as ſoon as he hath declared himſelf her Lover, and would deprive him of all the civil friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which ſhe had granted him before, by reaſon of the tenderneſs ſhe had for him; it is becauſe of this, that thoſe Lovers who are thus carried away by their paſſion ſcarce ever have good ſucceſs, becauſe that the VVomen ſeek above all things to have reſpect ſhowed them, and they think that to make a publick declaration of Love to them, is to bereave them of what is their due. I know no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet VVoman at leaſt but would be Offended at it, although ſhe might have a ſtrong incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for him that might ſpeak to her of his love. It is certain added the Counteſs <hi>d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyre,</hi> that we ſhali ſee no underſtanding VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that would not bluſh upon a like occaſion. That is true replied <hi>d'Arignan;</hi> but I pray tell me by what motion is it they bluſh, for I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it is not alwaies for anger: However it is rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ied the Marchioneſs, ſmiling at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>d'Arignan,</hi> it is my Opinion that a Gentleman ſhould make his actions and his ſighs ſpeak before he ſpeaketh himſelf; there are many ſaid <hi>d'Armenton</hi> as hath already been ſaid, that contribute to the revealing of a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers deſigns and inclination; a ſigh and a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:150024:114"/>
rendred in due ſeaſon a ſmall fear, ſome reſpects on a certain occaſion; all theſe things in their proper ſeaſon are oftentimes more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, and better underſtood than the ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt Rhetorick in the world; there is no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but may apprehend the Eyes meaning, thoſe are the faithful Meſſengers that bring the news of what paſſeth in the heart, and they have quite another power than the tongue; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they diſcover the moſt hidden thoughts, and penetrate ſometimes even to the heart of the perſons loved, and cauſe in them the ſame ardour with which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are inflamed: Do you believe that a Miſtreſs how deaf ſo ever ſhe ſeemeth, doth not underſtand what the eyes tell her; when ſhe ſeeth how pittifully they turn towards her, how they fix tpon hers, as if they were made faſt to them, and turn away again as if they were dazled: It is true it is good to Husband this Language, and to beware the diſcovering ones paſſion to thoſe from whom it ſhould be the moſt concealed. We ſeldome love without Jealouſie, or without a Rival, who continually obſerves the motion of theſe innocent Interpreters, eſpecially from perſons who are moſt to be ſuſpected: A Lover hath but two Eyes, and a Jealous Husband hath four, he ſeeth before and behind; for which reaſon a Judicious man ought to govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wiſely, and to behave himſelf according
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:150024:115"/>
to time and place, and when he hath cauſe to fear to deprive himſelf of ſo ſweet a pleaſure; the more ſecretly a Love is kept (I mean of theſe Loves which are not permitted, and which are now notwithſtanding very much A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamode) the ſweeter it is: and we know to how many evil Conſequences the leaſt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſubject to when it is revealed; and I ſaid the Cavaleer I believe that the great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret is not to make it ſo much a miſtery. We believe that an inclination doth not proceed ſo far, that they need to give themſelves the trouble to conceal it; and the world is now ſo much upon one matter, that they take the moſt amorous things for ſimple Gallantry, when they are done in company; whereas they that take the other part are in continual Alarms, becauſe indeed the leaſt appearance to them is a deaths wound; they imagine very often that there is more than they ſee, and more than there is, and it is a pleaſure to them to tell it, becauſe they believe it not to be known. How many Women are there who live with a Familiarity, without example with their Gallants, even before their Husbands, who perhaps would ſuſpect all things if they did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. I know one whoſe Husband is more jealous than any man, who could never endure that any one ſaw her except one of my friends, becauſe ſhe treateth him familiarly before his face, and yet it is the only One that ever hath
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:150024:115"/>
obtained the good-will of this Lady: Theſe things happen ſeldom replied <hi>d'Armenton,</hi> and for my part I hold that the ſureſt way is to love in private, and that one cannot be too cautious before thoſe that are Intereſſed. We muſt diſſemble, ſay that we leaſt think of, and uſe conſtraint conſtantly, or elſe we may be in danger to loſe all. I believe replyed <hi>de Ariguan,</hi> that theſe maxims are good, but ſo difficult to Obſerve, that they are almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a paſſionate Lover: We have not alwayes an occaſion to find a Miſtreſs without a witneſs, and there are ſome that are never to be ſeen but in company; and if we muſt always practice what you ſay, we run the danger of being long before we do our buſineſs, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to receive content. We muſt love in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility that it may not appear a little, when we ſee the perſon we love. Thoſe that know how to love as they ſhould do replyed <hi>de Armenton,</hi> find Expedients for all things, and meanes to make them to be underſtood, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have little Intelligence, without being underſtood by others, and without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muzing me to particularize all thoſe ſmall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets to you, ſince you cannot have been in love, for not to have known much your ſelf, I will only tell you what hapned a few dayes ſince in a company where I was; two Lovers whom the jealouſie of a Husband did for ſome time hinder them from ſeeing each other, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:150024:116"/>
in an aſſembly entertained each other moſt tenderly by the ſide of a Table, and which ſeemed moſt indifferent; there was none but I in the whole company that did ſuſpect their diſcourſe to be of Love; they were ſo expert as to uſe ſome indifferent matter to entertain each other aloud before the company, and from time to time when they talked of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſecrets of their hearts they ſpoke to each other ſoftly: And this ſcene continued above two hours without ſeeming to look one on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and as perſons that had the leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance together; there are yet many other pleaſant wayes upon which time, places, and the perſons muſt give a Diſcreet Lover coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, for it would be impoſſible to form certain Rules. In truth the matter is too large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Baron, &amp; it is Love that muſt inſtruct us in that, he who is the Father of Inventions, and who alwayes favoureth a Lover when he hath recourſe to him: But the thing which I would at preſent know, and which is not leſs important in Gallantry than it is to be diſcreet in publick, and to love in private: It is the manner how to conſerve our ſelves in our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes favour, for it is the chiefeſt thing we fail in, and of many Lovers who can perfectly gain the eſteem of a Lady; I ſee but very few that know how to conſerve it, which is a great defect, and which cauſeth us to enjoy the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to be loved, when we love but a little
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:150024:116"/>
time: I believe that after ſo many pretty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as hath been propoſed, this here may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the pains of a continued converſation. It is this that doth evidence the mens inconſtancy: I am certain at leaſt that we often-times need to ſeek no other cauſe than their unquiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is weary of a Happineſs as ſoon as they poſſeſs it, whatever trouble it hath coſt them to Obtain it: From thence you may judge whether the Women have no reaſon not to engage themſelves ſo far in Love, and never to ſubmit if they can avoid it: We may alſo replyed the Cavaleer accuſe the Women of Inconſtancy, but that is not the thing, and I believe that the ſamc meanes that are uſed to obtain the Ladies good wills, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſerve to maintain us in them, and the great ſecret in this is to endeavour alwayes to pleaſe them, and not to do any thing that may in any wiſe Offend them. It is no leſs difficult added <hi>d'Armenton</hi> to give Leſſons for this Article than for the other, becauſe there are ſo many cautions to obſerve, and ſo many Errors we are ſubject to commit, that there are many things to be examined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to the principal: The greateſt Lovers are commonly thoſe that commit the moſt faults, becauſe they are blinded by their paſſion, and becauſe that Love and Reaſon ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom accompany each other: If they are jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, they give way to a thouſand Follies, they
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:150024:117"/>
are not in the leaſt circumſpect they ſpeak ill of their Rivals, they offend the perſon they love a hundred wayes, they bring upon her a thouſand misfortunes, and endeavour to ruine her if they can; they are in love, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they have nothing to anſwer, be it to whom it will in their going aſtray; the ſhadow of a man near their Miſtreſs frighteth them, they cannot endure to let her ſee any body, even not in their preſence: If ſhe whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth to any one, thoſe are alarums which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their Senſes; if they turn their Eyes towards their Rivals, it is a Crime inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, and in fine, they put a double ſenſe to every word ſhe ſaith, of which there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſome one which they interpret to be in favour of thoſe they fear. But what are the fruits of all theſe Extravagancies? they ſerve but to diſpleaſe the mind of this Fair-one, who is at length weary of ſo unjuſt and inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a proceeding; there is nothing the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hate more than ſervitude, their ambition ever extendeth to command over thoſe whom they by Natures right ſhould Obey; and all their aim is to be disburthened of that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Yoak which Nature hath impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: If they cultivate their Beauty, it is but to obtain adoration: If they Love, it is but to make their Maſters become their ſlaves; but when theſe ſlaves will retake their firſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and play the Maſters, then is it their
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:150024:117"/>
diſpleaſure flameth, and that they deſpiſe to ſee themſelves miſuſed by people that had vowed them an eternal Servitude, cauſeth them to ſeek revenge; the greateſt part of Lovers loſe their Miſtreſſes in this manner. There are yet another ſort who are not ſo extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, but by a trick of vain fore-ſight render themſelves unhappy, and help forward the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of thoſe whom they would deſtroy; they will tell a Miſtreſs that ſuch a one doth love her to Oblige her to avoid him; they will entreat her not to be in his company alone, and not to give him occaſion to engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any further; and I remember ſomething to this effect which I heard not very long ſince touching a Lover of this ſort who made ſome reproaches to his Miſtreſs near to this purpoſe; why Madam ſaid he to her, will you ſeem thus obſtinate as to tell me he loveth You not? do not I ſee it? doth he not partake of all your counſels? doth he not affect to be in Your preſence? doth he not ſigh ſo ſoon as you caſt a look upon him? in fine, doth he not die for You? this perſon to whom he ſpoke, who was truly innocent, and who had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved none of theſe things becoming for the future more curious, found indeed that ſhe was loved, and the ſucceſs of theſe reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches was, that ſhe loved alſo, which ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had not done if this jealous one had not taken the trouble to give her notice, and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:150024:118"/>
forbid her; thus it is that theſe people through a ſtrange Imprudence are Authors of all the Evill that fall upon them; I have ſeen yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who have thought to make their Love ſecure by ſpeaking ill of their Rivals, and which it is that a VVoman ſeldom believeth ſo ſoon as ſhe knoweth the deſign: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as ſhe is perſwaded that it proceedeth from an effect of Jealouſie, ſhe doth but laugh at it, and will ſometimes take the part of him Intereſſed; in this I will confeſs my weakneſs anſwered the Baron to that, I am not capable of ſpeaking well of my Rivals, and when I have an opportunity to do them harm, I can ſcarce forbear it: I would know ſome more civil manner of ruining them. You know the Proverb replied the Count, which ſaith that when an Adverſary is in the water up to the middle, You muſt give him your Hand to help him out; but when he is in up to the Chin, You muſt ſet your foot on his head and drown him quite. There are many People that do the ſame with their Rivals, and until they find a fair Occaſion to ruine them quite, they diſſemble and live well with them, but ſo ſoon as they ſee them upon the brink of the Precipice, they give them the laſt puſh to throw them down. I ſay proceeded he what is done ſometimes, and not what I would counſel any one to do; for all theſe proceedings are ſome thing unworthy of a Gentleman, and I would
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:150024:118"/>
have a lover bear it above his Rivals by means of his merit and ſervices; it is eaſie for one that hath wit, and when a Miſtreſs knoweth the world, to cauſe her to obſerve the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between man and man, love and love, ſervice and ſervice. Moſt Lovers ruine themſelves, without it be neceſſary for a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val to work their ruine: There are ſome who full of Vanity, to give their Miſtreſſes a good Opinion of them, will boaſt of ſome Favours to her, which they perhaps never received. Others there are, who on the contrary will make as if they were misfortunate, and will aſſure one that they have never obtained any Love; as if it were no prejudice to them to be taxed of want of merit: But what do you think of thoſe that daily tell their Miſtreſſes that their Rivals are much happier than they, and that they reproach her, that ſhe treateth them beſt? I believe it is rather a meanes to ſerve ones Rival, than not to do it: There are yet a thouſand Rencounters in which many Lovers are undone, who have not the art of governing themſelves in their Felicity; and if Love be a Sea as they ſay, we muſt confeſs that Indiſcretion eſpecially is a ſhelf on which the greateſt part of theſe Gentle-men-ſighers ſuffer ſhipwrack; He that deſireth to pleaſe in Love, ought to know how to be reſpectful and diſcreet: and he that will rule muſt be ſilent. It is ſtrange ſaid the Marchioneſs (that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:150024:119"/>
diſcretion being the principalleſt quality a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ought to be endued with) that there ſhould be ſo few that make uſe of it, and that this ſecret muſt alwayes be recommended to the men. I avow anſwered the Baron to her, to our confuſion, that it is the moſt eſſential Vertue in Love, and which nevertheleſs we conſider the leaſt: There are very few men that have power to keep a Love ſecret, and were there not often many VVomen that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten oblige us to this weakneſs, I know not how we could excuſe our ſelves: it would be a very delightful matter replied Madam <hi>dEyrac</hi> for ſome of us to relate why there are ſo few men diſcreet: It ſhall be <hi>d'Armenton</hi> ſaid the Abbot, for he is much enclined to ſpeak for you againſt the men, and here is a ſubject will coſt him little. It ſhall be rather You replyed Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armond,</hi> for You have been long ſilent, and we will ſee a little, if after you have placed the Women ſo much beneath the men, You can retire the men from ſo naughty a walk, to place them only oppoſite to the Women. I know too little anſwered the Abbot what belongeth to Love to know how to reſolve You how to keep an amarous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery ſecret, and I will tell You no more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that than what I have read in <hi>Ovid. Ovid</hi> Sir, interrupted the Counteſs <hi>d'Ancyre,</hi> You quote to us a very pleaſant Author, Is it not he that counſelleth Lovers to feign themſelves
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:150024:119"/>
in drink when they are with their Miſtreſſes, that all the liberties they take with them may the more eaſily be excuſed; and in another place he propoſeth a fine manner of declaring Love; he ſaith that if we find an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be with our Miſtreſs at any Banquet, we muſt when we hold the glaſs in our hand, dip our finger in the Wine, and afterwards upon the Table write down our Love for her; I heard theſe from a Gentleman that had read <hi>Ovid</hi> very much, but would not imitate him. If this cuſtome replyed the Abbot, ſeemeth now rediculous to You, it was not perhaps in the dayes of <hi>Ovid:</hi> It is becauſe the men ſaid <hi>d'Arignan</hi> are now more knowing in Love, and I believe that if it were poſſible for <hi>Ovid</hi> to riſe again, he would cry up Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im's which he would expoſe to the Publick, that would now ſute with none but Serving-Maids. Let us leave <hi>Ovid</hi> then ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, and let us obſerve what the Abbot will tell us upon the Queſtion propoſed, ſince You will not anſwered the Abbot let me uſe this Author, I muſt tell You what I my ſelf conceive upon this matter: Firſt I believe that diſeretion conſiſteth in avoiding all things that may breed diſturbance, and make a noiſe; and on the other ſide beware, that in endeavouring to be too diſcreet, You be not at all: There are ſome Lovers who will not make uſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one in their Loves out of fear of truſting a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:150024:120"/>
ſecret with any one that may deceive them: But in all the Myſteries of this Nature a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is ſo neceſſary, that You cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; a man in Love is daily preſſed with his paſſion, he is ever deſirous to ſpeak, write to, or ſee his Miſtreſs, and to eaſe this eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which bereaveth him of his repoſe; He ſtandeth often in need of a perſon that is of his Intelligence, and endeavouring to do all, we ruine and deſtroy all: This Paſſion which tranſporteth us, and whoſe aim is only at ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, is not accuſtomed to be over-cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, it looks neither to the right nor to the left, but only before it, and ſo that there be not any thing to hinder her courſe, it ſeemeth not concerned at thoſe that follow it by ſight: There is nothing the world taketh ſo much paines in, than to diſcover the proceedings of an Inclination; they are all curious to know the ſecret of an Intrigue, and as ſoon as they diſcover the glimps of any thing, they will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate to the bottom: It is but ſuſpecting a a man in Love with a woman, to have a deſire to know the truth of what paſſeth, a he or ſhe confident of whoſe fidelity one is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſave a Lover from this danger, they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage a buſineſs better than he, they proceed with more care, and beſides their ſupplying with Counſels, and with the Favour they have with a Miſtreſs; they help many failings which a Lover would have committed: I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:150024:120"/>
a little upon this matter, for that there are many people who think themſelves very expert in Love, and who make it one of their moſt principal points in diſcretion, not to let any one know of tkeir Intrigue, and to make uſe of no body, but to do all things by themſelves: In the mean time You ſee that theſe nice ſpirtts abuſe themſelves, ſo groſly I ſay, that it is moſt certain that an aſſured con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident is the moſt Important matter in an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous commerce. To this let us add the pleaſure there is in telling a faithful friend the ſweets one hath taſted with a Miſtreſs, the charms of that amiable Creature, the joy one hath to love her, for theſe are certain things which lie heavy upon the heart of a Lover when he hath not the ſatisfaction to tell it to ſome Body. Do You not Obſerve ſaid the Dutcheſs Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, how the Abbot will prove himſelf unskilful in Love-affairs; however all that he hath ſayd even hitherto, is a ſubtil Gallantry. I know not replied the Counteſs <hi>d'Ermand,</hi> whither all that he hath hitherto ſaid be ſo gallant, but I find it not very near the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: The Queſtion is to know the Reaſon why the men are ſo Indiſcreet? and the Cautions that are to be Obſerved to practice this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and he goeth and telleth us the neceſſity there is to have a Confident, as if that had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Analogy with diſcretion: Yes Madam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Abbot to her, aſſuredly it hath; and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:150024:121"/>
You ſhall ſee if You will grant me the Favour to hear me, that I wander not ſo much from my Subject, I would bring the matter to the actions, which they ſhould not do publickly; for beſides that, ſomething of it hath already been ſaid: It were needleſs to give Leſſons for defaults, in which there are none but block-heads, and people full of Vanity that can fall into them. <hi>I</hi> choſe rather to uſe a ſubject ſomething more delicate, and to make it appear that that was not to be diſcreet to deſire to be too much; and that a man cannot be accuſed of Indiſcretion that confides his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret in a Friend who can ſerve him in that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; and becauſe of that, I have let You ſee of what Importance a Confident was: This is well juſtified ſaid the Dutcheſs, and although the Abbot did not directly anſwer the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on propoſed, I find that what we Treat of is not too far from the matter; That to declare that not only one may, but muſt have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in Love. We muſt have been in Love (proceeded the Abbot) to know how many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions are fit for a friend as I ſay in an Intrigue of Affection and the neceſſity there is to have one to whom one might communicate all things. The Abbot ſaid the Cavaleer will at length petſwade us maugre him, that he hath been in Love; for my part I am of his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I hold that is the ſafeſt way of loving to make uſe of a third perſon, and that we
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:150024:121"/>
are leſs ſubject to ſin againſt diſcretion. A Confident added the Baron doth doubtleſs much contribute to manage a Love-affair diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly: But to ſpeak truth, the Women are often the cauſe themſelves, (as I have already ſaid) of the faults which we commit againſt that Vertue, their evil conduct rendreth us Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, ſome for being too cruel, others by a certain ambition which they have to ſeek daily to make new Conqueſts, and to deſire the whole Univerſe to love them; thoſe who deck themſelves with cruelty, and who think they do themſelves honour by being Inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are conſtrained to love in the end, and they Imagine it ſo much Glory to ſee people ſuffer for their ſakes, that they would think they ſhould ruine all if they leſned any thing of their rigor; they look upon thoſe paines, thoſe reſtleſs minutes, and all thoſe Torments in which their Lovers live as Infallible tokens that they are beautiful, and they Triumph in that it dependeth upon them to render men happy or miſerable; the ambitious ones feed themſelves with rumour, and make their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conſiſt in the noiſe which the Croud of their Adorers make; they keep an account, and judge of the power of their Charmes by the quantity of their Lovers. It is eaſie to ſee that theſe two Characters of VVomen are capable of making us commit many Indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, excepting the danger they run of ever
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:150024:122"/>
meeting this conduct from true Lovers; ſome as much in love as they are, do in the end grow weary of ſuffering, and paſs from one extremity to another, when they will wholly oppreſs them. Others think it a trouble to divide a happineſs amongſt ſo many Rivals, which they thought they alone had well me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited. There is yet replied the Cavaleer, a ſort of women who Oblige the men to be no leſs Indiſcreet than the others, and theſe are thoſe who having many admirers, give them all hopes of being loved, and take delight to breed alwayes ſome jealouſie among them, they know how to detain thoſe that are ready to eſcape them, and to ſuppreſs the vanity of thoſe that dare promiſe themſelves too much from them, and who put too much confidence in the favours thry receive from them; they favour ſometimes one and ſometimes another, and cut the heart of this with a glance with which they Oblige the other; in fine, theſe are Miſtreſſes in Goſſipping, and not in love. Theſe are the ſprings of Hatred and Quarrels among Rivals, and theſe Fair-ones are thus the cauſe of many evil Conſequences. We may make a long diſcourſe againſt women ſaid <hi>d'Arignan,</hi> if we would examine all the reaſons they give us to deſtroy them. How many (without proceeding further) do we ſee of thoſe who after a Lover hath manifeſted to them all the poſſible Tokens of an extream
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:150024:122"/>
paſſion when they will have heard him, and when they have promiſed them that part in their heart which they could reaſonably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, begin when he leaſt thinketh of it, and findeth himſelf engaged not to revoak it to pretend difficulty, and to ſeem to doubt of his Inclinations, and make a pretence for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to begin all his cares and ſervices afreſh, as if he had yet done nothing; a Lover is well requited for the paines he hath taken by ſuch a Miſtreſs; he muſt needs be patient that deſpite doth not make him exceed the bounds of his duty. Thus indeed You ſee ſaid the Abbot how the one half of Your gallant La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are the cauſe of their own misfortune, and how the Indiſcretion of men is ofteneſt a cauſe of their Evil conduct; yes if we will believe You ſaid the Marchioneſs; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to none but us to let You ſee that for one Imprudent woman, there are ten thouſand Impertinent Ones; if we muſt give them their Name, it would be a long peice of work for us to undertake to tell You how many men there are of this ſort. I believe anſwered her the Cavaleer, that there are but few of the kind You mention, but the VVomen have given them cauſe to be ſo. By your leave Sir, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Counteſs <hi>d'Ancyre,</hi> is there any thing that can Oblige a man to be diſhoneſt, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent? The ſame things replied the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leer go not always by the ſame name, and there
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:150024:123"/>
are Crimes which reaſon and juſtice authorize; I know Miſtreſſes who ſell their Favours too dear to content them only for having received them, we ſhould think very often that we had paid too much for them, had we not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of them by the pleaſure: The Cavaleer ſmiled at theſe words, to which Madam <hi>d'Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac</hi> anſwered that they ſhould no more be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours if they could be bought, and that a Lover ſhould not think himſelf honoured by them, when he had not obtained them by the power of his merit as much as by his ſervices.</p>
               <p>Here the Converſation ended; it had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued longer if the artificial Fire-works had not waſted a part of the Evening: But however the enſuing Song was ſung admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble well by Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armond</hi> at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Company.</p>

               <p>THe Sevenrh day, or rather the Seventh E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, ſince we muſt here end, and ſince it is the laſt Converſation with which I ſhall entertain the Reader, the Company met ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing betimes in the Garden, where waiting for the Dutcheſs whom ſome affair had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, they ſpent the time in dancing ſome Branlies round a Fountain; <hi>d'Armenton</hi> who was in an Age wherein Dancing is almoſt out of ſeaſon, acquitted himſelf notwithanding ſo well, that we might aſſuredly ſay that Age is not the ſame with all the world: At this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant the Dutcheſs arrived, and although ſhe had long known <hi>d'Armenton,</hi> ſhe could not forbear ſmiling to ſee a man thus triumph in Dancing, who had paſſed fifty Years of his Age; By what I perceive ſaid ſhe, <hi>dArmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> hath not forgot what he learned formerly. What Madam ſaid he preſently, do You ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine me ſo Old that I muſt not be permitted to be concerned in what You do now? I will not ſay that, anſwered him the Dutcheſs on the contrary I find that You act every thing ſo well that You undertake, that in truth a man like You may concern himſelf in all things; but this Expertneſs which You have is not ſo
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:150024:125"/>
general, but that it may be true to ſay that Dancing like Love and Gallantry are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together diverſions for perſons of your Age, and I, I believe Madam replyed the ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that we are never more capable of the things You ſpeak of, than in the Age wherein I am; and for Love, it belongeth to us to make uſe of it as we ought. You were a very Ingenious man ſaid the Cavaleer to him, if You would take upon You the Trouble to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e us underſtand what you there ſay, for in my Opinion it is a thing very difficult to maintain, and I believe there is no Body here but is againſt it, and but who would be glad to hear You diſcourſe upon a matter ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Opinion of all the world. Thus ſaid the Lady <hi>Sindal,</hi> we have accidentally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a matter for a very pleaſant Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. If You pleaſe Madam added ſhe, in addreſſing her ſelf to the Dutcheſs, this we will fix upon; the Evening is delightful, and the place wherein we are very pleaſant, and me-thinks I ſee <hi>d'Armenton</hi> ready to relate to us ſomething that is Gallant, to make us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that Gallantry is a Land wherein People that are endued with his Qualities, and with a wit ſo ready as his, may at all times enter; the Dutcheſs did not Oppoſe this deſigne, and the reſt of the Company doing like the Dutcheſs they formed a Ring upon a green Bank, after which <hi>d'Armenton</hi> ſeeing them ready to give
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:150024:125"/>
him attention, began in this manner.</p>
               <p>I ſee well ſaid (he ſmiling) that it is to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie what I alwayes take ſo much paines to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal, to deſire to maintain that Love apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth more to a man who exceedeth fifty, than to thoſe who are not twenty or twenty one. But ſince I have undertaken it I will not recoil, I ſhall at leaſt give You to underſtand, that though I am Old, Age is not ſuch as the Vulgar believe it to be, and that it is without reaſon that they would deprive them of the pleaſures of Love, that they know how to take and to reliſh them more happily than Youth: You muſt firſt give me leave if You pleaſe before any thing elſe, to make a ſmall digreſſion, and to tell You firſt what Love is, and in what that Felicity conſiſteth which Lovers find, and afterwards you will agree with me, that this paſſion doth not Illy ſuite with gray hairs, and that one muſt be no man at all not to be capable. Love then according to the Ancients, is a deſire to enjoy beauty and ſince we deſire nought but what we know, it muſt neceſſarily be that knowledg pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth deſire, the eyes, reaſon, and the mind cauſeth us to know the happineſs, and this knowledg produceth in us the deſire to poſſeſs it; the Eyes diſcovereth, Reaſon choſeth, the Mind judgeth of what the Eyes and Reaſon have done. Beauty though the moſt ſenſible thing in the world, is nevertheleſs the moſt
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:150024:126"/>
difficult to know, it never appeareth with more charms than upon the face of a Woman; and Heaven who is marvellous in all the works it hath done, is in nothing ſo admirable as here; it is a work which bringeth men even to Idolatry, both Old and Young are dazled, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one deſireth it, but deſire it differently, becauſe of the different knowledg they have of it. When this Beauty hapneth to ſtrike the eyes of a Young man, ſhe doth as ſoon van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh him, and in ſeducing theſe two Innocent Interpreters by I know not what pleaſure with which they are ſo enchanted, that they Introduce it even to the heart, which being no more cautious than the Eyes, ſuffereth it ſelf to be caught in this ſweet ſnare: I ſay much more it feeleth a certain Joy which tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, and empoyſons it ſelf in a manner that it ſighs for it that it is tormented with a daily deſire. Oh the ſtrange diſorder! when a heart is cumbred with all theſe deſires by which it ſuffereth it ſelf to be lead, and which deſires, being no leſs blind than the heart, cauſe it to make a thouſand miſtakes; it thinketh on nought but the Object that hath ſtruck it, it ſeeketh and followeth it every where, not to be revenged on the harm it hath given it, but to unite it ſelf wholly to it, and thinketh that in poſſeſſing of it, it ſhall be eaſed from the torment it ſuffereth. Nevertheleſs it decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it ſelf, and even the pleaſure of this poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:150024:126"/>
is a Lyar. It is a groſs error wherein the moſt of theſe people fall that ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be blinded at the firſt glance of Beauty, to make the aim of their Love a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal pleaſure to ſatisfie themſelves, which they have no ſooner compaſſed, but they ceaſe not only from having the ſame ardour, but paſs even to diſdain, &amp; look upon him no otherwiſe but a loathing that which before was the Idol of their heart. It ſeemeth as though this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire repented for what it had done; that it is vexed it is deceived, that it believed that to be all a heart could deſire; the heart who on his part acknowledgeth the fault it had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſeemeth alſo to reproach the Eyes of their blindneſs, to take a happineſs in appearance for the true one, he is not ſatisfied in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but Imagining the Felicity he promiſed to himſelf to be yet far diſtant hence, deſires augment in him as if he poſſeſſed nothing, which maketh it clearly apear that that is not the true Felicity he ſeeketh, and that theſe Young Lovers have a way of loving which is not happy, or rather that they know not how to Love ſince they are never ſatisfied, although they arrive to what they aſpired; and this is it we may well term unhappineſs, for there is both paine and trouble at the end as well as at the beginning of this Love. They ceaſe neither complaints, ſufferings, nor ſighings, and even then when they believe themſelves at
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:150024:127"/>
the height of their deſires, it is then they have more ſubject of deſire, and that they find themſelves unfortunate? It is a precipice in which this fooliſh ardour doth caſt them, which cannot juſtly be termed Love; it is here where Youth Embarquing in foul weather pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth; he is carried away with all ſorts of winds, he followeth his deſires, and never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulteth his paſſion: Reaſon is too weak with him to reſiſt this Torrent: He permitteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be led away; every Guide is a Guide for him, and if he may be carried towards the Object he cheriſheth; he forſaketh himſelf, and will follow even his own Enemies; he knoweth not ſo much as how to diſtinguiſh the true from the falſe, he is blind who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good for evil, and who feedeth himſelf with every thing which his will and deſires will perſwade him to, who being of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Incapable of diſcerning any thing, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to render him miſerable. You ſee then how thoſe who are poſſeſſed with this blind paſſion (altogether contrary to the laws of Reaſon) do never find thoſe ſolid pleaſures in Love which thoſe take whoſe riper Years hath learned them to know them. This being ſuppoſed (as it is moſt certain) I ſay that it hapneth otherwiſe to thoſe Perſons who are come to the age by me before-mentioned. This ardour which Time hath layed aſleep in them, re-kindleth at the ſight of a Beauty, for
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:150024:127"/>
whom they breathe ſighs which are guided by a choice that is reaſonable, which detaineth them from wandring; they approach her, and enjoy her without any confuſion; their deſign is pure, and the effect of it is nought but Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; the bridle of Reaſon who reproveth the folly of the Senſes, ſuf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ereth not it ſelf to ſlacken into Repentance, they have what they deſire, and without any trouble they reliſh the pleaſures they ſeek: A man I ſay arrived to thoſe Years wherein I am (for I may well place my ſelf here) and who is not tranſported with this violent ardour, beholdeth Beauty, and knoweth it as much as can be; he findeth wherewithall to be charmed in the face of a Woman: That juſt proportion of ſo many parts, that agreeable accord of the Faireſt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, that luſtre that ſhadow ſo well ordered, ſo many marvels which he diſcerneth there to gliſter, which do both aſtoniſh and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant him, cauſeth him to conſider matters more than he can expreſs: But is he not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled in ſuch a manner as to make him forget what he is? Reaſon reſiſteth the Enchantment, his Soul is too diſcreet to be deceived, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahough ſhe doth extreamly deſire this Beauty; her deſires give her nothing but a ſweet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs: In fine ſhe enjoyeth this Beauty; but ſhe is ſo jealous of the pleaſure ſhe taketh, that ſhe would not communicate it to the Body; It is in the higheſt part of the Soul
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:150024:128"/>
that this pleaſure reſideth where the ſenſes have no Intelligence. Truly it were an offence to Beauty, and a thing beneath her, (ſhe the only pretious thing in the world) to deſign it for the Body, and who being made to rule over what is moſt high in man, to ſubject her ſelf to what is moſt beneath her; there is nought but the Soul which can aſpire to this ſweet Union, becauſe there is none but ſhe that underſtandeth the happineſs, you will doubtleſs ſay that the Soul doth not alſo make it difficulty to deſire when ſhe is in the depth of this poſſeſſion: It is true, but it is always to poſſeſs Beauty, and for fear of loſing it; whereas the Young people deſire quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than that which they have poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe their deſires are not contented with ſo ſhort a pleaſure which they loſe in the moment they have it, for which reaſon they are never without grief, nor without loathing it is not beyond Reaſon than to ſay that the perſons who are ſomething advanced in Age, are thoſe who are the moſt fit to love. We muſt be aſſuredly Old ſaid the Baron to him to comprehend this Love well; and we muſt be more than you are to content our ſelves: I know not in good Faith what you could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, if (as Old as you are) we ſhould freely ask You to know of You if you loved in no other manner than as you ſay. <hi>d'Armenton</hi> anſwered him but with a laugh, whom the reſt
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:150024:128"/>
of the company did alſo Imitate; and a little after the Cavaleer taking up the word, ſaid that <hi>d'Armenton</hi> had reaſon to attribute this love to Old-Folks, for it muſt have been in Old Times; for now whether they are undeceived by theſe Lovers in Idea, or whether they love in quite another manner; and even thoſe who are Older than we, muſt have found that in that (whatſoever <hi>d'Armenton</hi> can ſay) we are more reaſonable than they, ſince thoſe that concern themſelves therein act juſt like us. It is certain ſaid <hi>d'Arignan</hi> that Love requireth ſomething that is more ſenſible; and that as the Soul and Body entreth into communion with the Evils of this Nature, they ought alſo to partake of the ſweets: this is ſo true, that the Soul cannot well conceal the pleaſures of Love, and taſte them in a retreat, ſhe cannot do it ſo wel, but the ſenſes muſt take part in theſe pleaſures; they preſently diſcern mirth ſeated in the Viſage, the Eyes ſparkle, there is ſweetneſs and raptures found; all theſe ſpeak ſo well of this admirable Intelligence, that it is only by that that the Soul is judged to reſt contented, therefore it is a vain thing to make a love apart for the Soul, and another for the Body; the Intereſt is the ſame, their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and enjoyments are together, they act and repoſe for one and the ſame reaſon; and it is by the means of the Senſes that the Soul knoweth Love, ſhe can alſo not be without
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:150024:129"/>
them in taſting the pleaſures of Love. Since you never were in Love anſwered him <hi>d'Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menton</hi> after the manner I mean, I muſt not thnk it ſtrange that You know not its ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Soul is ſo well capable of taſting the pleaſures of Love alone without the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies participation, that the pleaſures are not true ones as ſoon as that partaketh, but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſoaked in Tears, which begin and end al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in grief. Well Sir ſaid the Baron to him, love you after this delicate manner that we may not envy you, and leave us in the error in which we are, and where we will continue that Love, having Charmes for the Body as well as the Souls the joy may ſpread all over: But to come to Age, I received a Letter not long ſince from the ſame Friend that writ to me concerning Jealouſie, who maketh me diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that not only an Aged man ought not to Love, but that if he would he cannot; if the Company pleaſe they ſhall hear it. There was none but deſired to hear this Letter, even to <hi>d'Armenton,</hi> who entreated him to defer no longer the doing them this pleaſure; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained theſe words.</p>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:150024:130"/>
can devine the half of what I would ſay I muſt not relate all; let us obſerve Old Folks another way, and we ſhall find that being far enough from hope, nothing is ſo natural to them as to fear, whether it be that it proceedeth from their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or from the experience they have that the world is but a cheat: How can we make it appear afier this that they love? if they are in continual apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be deceived. I remember ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this purpoſe which one of my Friends told me not long ago, that an Old man might love a perſon much inferiour to him, and of an indifferent Beauty that may make him hope to be loved again by reaſon ſhe is not amiable enough to be loved of another; but who is it that ſeeth not that there is more of wit than truth in this reaſon, becauſe it is firſt neceſſary that Love cometh either from choice or deſtiny, as for example, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny cauſeth that two hearts love each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when it hapneth that they are both born under the ſame aſcendant, or that the ſame Planet ruleth the life of both; it is
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:150024:131"/>
certain that theſe two Perſons love intirely. Again, we may love by dcſtiny when there is a reſemblance of humors as Phyſicians argue, and in many others which I could tell You: If it were requiſite to tell you all the opinions they have upon this Subject, we cannot ſay that theſe good Old Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are capable of this love when they choſe a Miſtreſs, for they are not aſſured that ſhe they ſhall take for the Object of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires hath a humor like them; that ſhe hath the ſame Aſcendant, or that ſhe is born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Planet, they are I ſay no more aſſured, than to know how to bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it. If we will now that love co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to an Old man by choice, ſince in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect he ſeeketh her whom he thinketh eaſieſt to win, I ſay that love comporteth himſelf to all that are good, or fair or that ſeem ſo: If it be thus, I pray tell me what reaſon is there to believe that an Old man can be in love if he ſeeketh that which is leſs amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it is rather a token of Choler and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred which he hath againſt himſelf, than a ſigne of love; it ſeemeth as though he would puniſh himſelf for the ſmalneſs of his merit,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:150024:131"/>
or that he hath deſpight for not knowing how to aſpire to ſomething better compoſed. We alſo ſee that moſt of your Gray beards addreſs themſelves commonly to none but perſons that are made unhappy by the way of Fortune, or to thoſe that have not too much wit to be ſuccesful in their deregulate affections: But yet this cannot be called love for the reaſon I have already mentioned, ſince conſidering theſe two evil qualities in them, it is impoſſible they can have any love no more than esteem. If the Object they choſe be in miſery, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (as in effect it is true) that it is the Eſtate they love in them, and not their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that they would have no love for them, did they not buy it, and that they courted them for nought but to pick their pockets; In the mean time as in this thing they are moſt ſenſible, and ſince they behold their Mistreſſes like ſo many Harpies, I believe they cannot have any love for them. And for the last Reaſon, I conclude that an Old man is incapable of love, becauſe he thinketh himſelf not loved again. But ſhould there be found in the world Women with ſo little
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:150024:132"/>
ſenſe as to love men of their Age. I ſay that notwithſtanding they would have no love for them, judging themſelves unworthy to be loved by people like them. I am, &amp;c.</p>

It is true added Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armond</hi> that you will do your ſelf an ill turn by it, for I know a Lady who hath paſſed Forty Years, and who nevertheleſs ſhall diſpute her Beauty with all the handſome Women in the Univerſe. No, no ſaid the Dutcheſs, the Abbot is not juſt in that, for even as the hard-favoured Women are Old when they are firſt born; even ſo on the ontrary, the Fair-ones conſerve their handſome Features even almoſt to the laſt; and their Autumn hath this priviledge of being more pleaſing, and more agreeable than the Spring of the others. There are ſome Women who in their Fiftieth Year have ſuch beautiful remnants, that they are capable to move the paſſions at firſt ſight; why ſhould it not be permitted to them to love what they may find amiable. Madam replyed the Abbot, you may ſay what you pleaſe, but Age effaceth all that is amiable in your Sex, and I would willingly adviſe all VVomen to imitate the Empreſs <hi>Poppea,</hi> who prayed to the Gods that it
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:150024:134"/>
would pleaſe them to let her dye before ſhe ſaw Old Age with which her Looking-glaſs did already threaten her. You have declared your ſelf ſo much an enemy to VVomen ſaid the Marchioneſs to him, that although Your Counſels might be wholſome, yet we ſhould make difficulty to follow them; we muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with you that there are but few Beauties that are able to reſiſt time. But are none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amiable but thoſe that are beautiful and a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Soul doth ſhe never borrow a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation for the Body as a pretious ſtone doth for the Mettle that Environeth it. I know not anſwered her the Abbot what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the VVomen if their beauty were not the cauſe that we ſeek them, and that we ſhun <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Deformed Ones. Again it ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that a fair and ſpotleſs Soul Inhabiteth in an ugly Body. The Exte ior Beauty is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a Token of the Inward Goodneſs, it is a character by which the Soul is known, and in which Phyſiognomiſts make their whole Art conſiſt. In a word, Deformity is ſo much an enemy to Happineſs, that me-thinks it is a Scare Crow to all that meet it. I had procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Abbot a Song given me not long ago by a Friend, wherein is diſplayed how unfit it is for hard-favoured VVomen to Inhabit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Mortals; ſo pulling it out of his pocket, he read it as followeth, and after deſired Madamoiſelle <hi>d'Armond</hi> to ſing it.</p>

               <p>The Abbot ſpoke with ſo much ardour and action, that the Company could not forbear laughing; he ought not to have apprehended that any one would take the deformed Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens parts, for although there were none here but what were extream Beautiful, there are
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:150024:136"/>
none but flatter themſelves on this ſcore. The Converſation dured a while; it was a matter which was large, and which would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced more.
